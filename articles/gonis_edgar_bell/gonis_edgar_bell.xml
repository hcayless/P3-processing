               <p xml:id="p1">‘I am very glad the Zeno papyri have arrived safely, and am sure Edgar would be grateful for any information about double dates.’ This quotation is taken from a letter written by Grenfell to Bell on 1 June 1919, shortly after the British Museum had purchased a group of Zenon papyri from the Cairo dealer Maurice Nahman,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Maurice Nahman (1868–1948) was the most famous Cairo dealer at that time; see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/84769">Hagen–Ryholt 2016</ref>: 253–255.</p></note> in April 1919 (P.Lond. inv. 2079–2101). Edgar had recently published two articles on Early Ptolemaic chronology,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar 1917 and Edgar 1918a.</p></note> and had begun the publication of the Zenon papyri of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo in a series of articles.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3"><p style="text-align: justify; "> This series, “Selected Papyri from the Archives of Zenon”, in <seg style="font-style: italic;">Annales du Service des Antiquités</seg>, is referred to as P.Edg. in the <ref target="https://papyri.info/docs/checklist">Checklist</ref>.</p></note> It did not take long for Bell to write to Edgar, whose first letter in this assemblage is dated 12 August 1919. As expected, it concerned the Zenon papyri in London and their dates. The first letter was followed by several others on the same topic; the two correspondents came closer over the years, with ‘Dear Mr Bell’ replaced by the more familiar ‘Dear Bell’ from 1923.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="4"><p style="text-align: justify; "> It is not known whether the two had been in contact earlier. Edgar had turned to papyrology only a few years earlier. They were both students at Oriel College, Oxford, but six years apart: Edgar matriculated in 1891 (not in 1890, as reported in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/36812">Guéraud 1939</ref>: 3, and then <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/76106">Pellé 2007</ref>: 181), having previously studied at Glasgow; and Bell in 1897 (Shadwell 1902: 677, 710).</p></note></p>
               <p xml:id="p2" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Edgar’s letters (Bell’s are not available and may be presumed lost) preserve moments in the history of the making of P.Cair.Zen. and of the nascent stages of the future <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/8390">P.Lond. 7</ref>. Numerous letters discuss readings in Zenon papyri in London and Cairo (<seg style="font-weight: bold;">1</seg>–<seg style="font-weight: bold;">5</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">7</seg>–<seg style="font-weight: bold;">9</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">12</seg>–<seg style="font-weight: bold;">15</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">20</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">27</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">33</seg>), as well as in Manchester (<seg style="font-weight: bold;">30</seg>–<seg style="font-weight: bold;">31</seg>); almost all this discussion resulted in something concrete in the publications. The Zenon papyri acquired by Michigan also make a frequent appearance in the correspondence (<seg style="font-weight: bold;">16</seg>–<seg style="font-weight: bold;">19</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">23</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">29</seg>), chiefly in relation to practicalities of their study and publication. Apart from editorial matters, the history of papyrus collections also receives coverage. The publication of the Zenon papyri in Florence had shown that fragments of the same papyrus could be divided between different collections, and the London acquisitions held the potential for further such joins. If it were discovered that fragments in one collection complete any papyri in the other, would an exchange be possible, as had been done with Florence, ‘to the advantage of both collections’ (<seg style="font-weight: bold;">9</seg>)? ‘There would be no difficulty on our side, but you may perhaps be bound to stricter rules’, Edgar noted. In the end, four London papyri that joined with others in Cairo were included in P.Cair.Zen.,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5" n="5"><p style="text-align: justify; "> P.Lond. inv. 2352, published as part of P.Cair.Zen. 1 59062, and later republished with an additional fragment as <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1510">P.Lond. 7 1943</ref>; inv. 2318A, published in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/804">P.Cair.Zen 2 59156</ref>; inv. 2344, part of <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/828">P.Cair.Zen 2 59182</ref>; and inv. 2320, part of <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1445">P.Cair.Zen 5 59821</ref>. In the preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95110">P.Cair.Zen. 1</ref>, Edgar thanks ‘H. I. Bell for showing me his transcripts of the unpublished material in the British Museum and for kindly enabling me to complete several of the texts in this volume’.</p></note> but the originals remained in London. Cairo, or rather Edgar, presented to London two fragments that physically belonged with inv. 2312 = <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2384">P.Lond. 7 1941</ref> and inv. 2096 = <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1579">P.Lond. 7 2017</ref>.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn6" n="6"><p style="text-align: justify; "> See letters <seg style="font-weight: bold;">8</seg> and <seg style="font-weight: bold;">16</seg>.</p></note></p>
               <p xml:id="p3" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Other letters refer to Petrie papyri in the British Museum, mostly from the <ref target="http://www.trismegistos.org/archive/122">archive of Kleon and Theodoros</ref> (<seg style="font-weight: bold;">2</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">22</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">23</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">25</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">26</seg>), an assemblage contemporary to Zenon’s. There are several new readings, but not all of them have been published.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn7" n="7"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar may have planned a comprehensive re-edition of the letters of the archive but only republished four of them (<ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34083">Edgar 1932</ref>). The introduction to <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2492">P.Pestm.Zen. C</ref> (= P.Petr. Kleon 17) acknowledges ‘an unpublished transcription by C. C. Edgar, which was put at our disposal by T. C. Skeat’. This comes from a notebook with a brief introduction and transcriptions in loose leaves, which is the source of readings attributed to ‘Edgar <seg style="font-style: italic;">in schedis</seg>’ in P.Petr. Kleon (personal communication from Willy Clarysse, whom we thank). Cf. n. *88.</p></note> Suggestions on another Petrie papyrus (<seg style="font-weight: bold;">28</seg>) have also remained unpublished. Some emendations were published only indirectly (<seg style="font-weight: bold;">21</seg>), while others coincide with corrections proposed by others in more recent years (<seg style="font-weight: bold;">24</seg>).</p>
               <p xml:id="p4" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Letters <seg style="font-weight: bold;">32</seg> and <seg style="font-weight: bold;">34</seg> relate to Edgar’s work on <seg style="font-style: italic;">Select Papyri</seg>. As indicated in Hunt’s preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3040">Select Papyri I</ref>, dated May 1932, Edgar ‘recently took upon himself the bulk of the work’. We now learn that he assisted Hunt by taking over the Greek texts, i.e. their copying in the first instance, and the translations, which was the greatest but also the dullest share of the workload. Edgar expressed a sense of inadequacy in relation to the task (letter <seg style="font-weight: bold;">32</seg>), which is understandable; he had come to papyrology some twenty years later than Hunt,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn8" n="8"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar’s earlier field of study was archaeology; his first papyrological article dates from 1917 (Edgar 1917).</p></note> and his expertise was in the early Ptolemaic period, whereas the selection spanned a millennium. These letters, too, contain textual suggestions that have received little notice.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn9" n="9"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Several new readings are indicated as ‘E.-H.’ or ‘revised reading’ in the apparatus to <seg style="font-style: italic;">Select Papyri</seg>. Only a small number of these have been reported in the <seg style="font-style: italic;">Berichtigungsliste</seg>.</p></note></p>
               <p xml:id="p5" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The last letter (<seg style="font-weight: bold;">35</seg>) signals the beginning of Edgar’s penultimate editorial project. This was also prompted by Hunt, although unintentionally. After Hunt’s death on 18 June 1934, Edgar ‘undertook the very laborious task of completing the work on Part ii of Vol. iii of the Tebtunis papyri’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn10" n="10"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell 1938: 134. <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/23487">Youtie (1942</ref>: 244) called it a ‘repugnant task’.</p></note> In the preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3740">P.Tebt. III.2</ref>, Edgar noted that ‘the bulk of the material had not yet been examined by’ Hunt, and he was anxious not to appear inferior to the task: ‘I can only hope that the transitions from his hand to mine are not too apparent.’ Hardly anyone, however, would make such a comparison, and ‘it should be made clear that chief credit is due to Edgar’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn11" n="11"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/23484">Skeat 1939</ref>: 218; Skeat, working in the British Museum, had first-hand knowledge of the making of the volume. Cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/23487">Youtie 1942</ref>: 245.</p></note> Like Hunt, Edgar did not live to see the volume in print, as he died shortly before its appearance, on 9 May 1938.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn12" n="12"><p style="text-align: justify; "> See Bell 1938: 134. The 9th is the date given in Edgar’s death notice and probate; biographical notices and even the inscription on his grave refer to the 10th.</p></note> He had almost completed his work on <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3949">P.Cair.Zen. 5</ref>, published posthumously; this was a fitting conclusion to Edgar’s journey in papyrology, which began and ended with Zenon.</p>
               <p xml:id="p6" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Letters <seg style="font-weight: bold;">1</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">5</seg>–<seg style="font-weight: bold;">8</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">10</seg>, and <seg style="font-weight: bold;">16</seg> are written on lined white paper, close to A4 size; <seg style="font-weight: bold;">4</seg> on a sheet with printed letterhead; <seg style="font-weight: bold;">11</seg>–<seg style="font-weight: bold;">13</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">15</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">17</seg>–<seg style="font-weight: bold;">21</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">23</seg>–<seg style="font-weight: bold;">26</seg>, and <seg style="font-weight: bold;">28</seg>–<seg style="font-weight: bold;">34</seg> on standard letter sheets; <seg style="font-weight: bold;">2</seg>–<seg style="font-weight: bold;">3</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">9</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">22</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">27</seg>, and <seg style="font-weight: bold;">35</seg> on standard letter sheets folded in the middle; <seg style="font-weight: bold;">14</seg> is a postcard.

            <p xml:id="p7" style="text-align: left; ">Antiquities Dept. | 12.8.19</p>
            <p xml:id="p8" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Mr. Bell,</p>
            <p xml:id="p9" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for your letter and postcard. It was very kind of you to send me these chronological notes, and I am very glad to know what the B.M. collection contains in the way of evidence concerning the different systems of dating. </p>
            <p xml:id="p10" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">In no. 2088 I wonder if it is possible to restore  λ Δαισίου ια, Παῦνι ια .<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn13" n="13"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1530">P.Lond. 7 1967</ref>. The date appears in the edition as ̣ λ̣α̣, Δ̣α̣ι̣σ̣ί[ο]υ̣ ι̣  ̣, Π̣αῦνι ια (l. 7), with the note that ‘Δαισίου ια could be read’.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p11" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If the date of no. 2097 is year 39, Phamenoth 10 (and not year 35),<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn14" n="14"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1570">P.Lond. 7 2008</ref>. The year is also read as 39 in the edition. </p></note> an interesting question is raised. On the generally accepted chronology (which I see no reason for disputing), Ptolemy II died in the early spring of his 39th canonical or Egyptian year, several months before Phamenoth 10. But the date \of 2097/ may quite well refer to the financial year,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn15" n="15"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The edition also takes it to be the financial year.</p></note> for some new evidence has come to light that the financial year began in Mecheir, in the reign of Ptolemy II as well as Ptolemy III. So Phamenoth of financial year 39 would be equivalent to Phamenoth of the 38th Egyptian year and (I think, but this is more doubtful) to Phamenoth of the 37th Macedonian year. Why is it that while so many papyri are dated year 39 of Ptolemy II and year 2 of Ptolemy III, scarcely any belong to year 1 (see the index to P. Hib. and P. Petrie)?<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn16" n="16"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/54529">Pestman et al. 1981</ref>: 198. </p></note> It may be a mere accident, but I think a more probable explanation is that a large number of papyri || are dated by the financial year, and the financial year 1 of Euergetes was extremely short, not more than a month and a half.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn17" n="17"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar offers a synthesis on ‘the problem of dating’ in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, pp. 50–57. The conclusion (p. 55) does not differ from his views expressed in this letter. On the chronology in the Zenon papyri, see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/54529">Pestman et al. 1981</ref>: 215–222, which however is not the definitive account; cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/79269">Bennett 2011</ref>.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p12" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">	With regard to no. 2092 and the reading of the docket,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn18" n="18"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1542">P.Lond. 7 1979</ref>. When the docket was deciphered, it was shown that it did not refer to Zenon’s father.</p></note> the name of Zenon’s father appears to have been Agreophon.

            <p xml:id="p31" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The papyrus containing the epigrams has now been photographed, but I am afraid the photo is a little smaller than the original.

            <p xml:id="p49" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for your interesting letter, which I have just received. Yes, I called on you at the British Museum in September, but found you were away on leave. Perhaps I may be more fortunate next summer. The fine Zenon papyri which you mention were offered to us indirectly last spring, but the price asked was far beyond our resources.

Your no. 2312 now gives the gist of the first half. Something of this sort seems to have happened. Hierokles wrote no. 11 first, found it not quite satisfactory, and wrote the other two letters instead of it. But by some mistake no. 11 was sent to Zenon as well as the other two; perhaps by a different messenger, as it arrived a day later. I infer that no. 11 was the rejected copy from the fact that it is less correctly expressed. See especially the phrase in l. 2: ἔγραψάς μοι εἰ μὲν ἀκρειβῶς ἐπιστάμεθα ἀλείφειν αὐτόν    . As the words stand this means ‘you told us to train him if we know exactly how to do so’. But the new letter shows that Hierokles meant to say ‘if we are perfectly sure that he will win’. Incidentally it makes two other points quite clear, 1) that Pyrrhos was being trained to compete in the games and 2) that Hierokles wrote from Alexandria (see the expression καταγαγηις in l.11).</p>

Let us hope he will succeed.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn64" n="64"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Hunt had written to Bell on 31 July 1927 (BL Add. MS 59512, f. 176): ‘Segrè might be tried for bibliography if no one else at home can be got, but he always strikes me as rather inaccurate and I should prefer an Englishman if one can be found. I can’t say why || J.G. Milne won’t: he has plenty of time, surely. Another possibility occurs to me in C.C. Edgar who has just left Egypt for good. I should imagine that he is likely to settle somewhere within reach of books. He wrote lately that he hopes to be in Oxford shortly and would like to see me, so I could mention it if you like.’ Bell had been responsible for compiling the bibliography for Graeco-Roman Egypt in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> since 1914. The instalment published in 1927 was signed by three contributors (Bell et al. 1927), with a note by Bell explaining the background. His promotion to Deputy Keeper in 1927 increased the difficulty of the task. The next instalment was the work of eight contributors (Milne et al. 1928); J.G. Milne was among them, but not Edgar (or Segrè). Edgar only contributed the section on ‘Publications of non-literary texts’ in the bibliography for 1932–1933 (Milne et al. 1934: 88–92), replacing Bell.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p127" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">At present I am compiling the Index to my catalogue, a long but unavoidable piece of drudgery, but I hope to come next week to the B.M., Tuesday or Wednesday, and put in a few || hours on the Michigan papyri.

This had been the plan for some time (‘Volume VI of the Museum Catalogue is likely to consist entirely of Ptolemaic texts.’ [Bell 1922: 100]), and this remained the case in the years that followed (‘vol. VI … will consist entirely of Ptolemaic papyri’ [<ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34376">Bell 1933</ref>: 514]). The project was subsequently handed over to T. C.

            <p xml:id="p140" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I have not yet gone through the text very carefully but there is one suggestion which I cannot refrain from making. In l. 14 is it not possible to read ἐν] Ναυ[κρ]άτι ? If that is right, the tablets are probably an account of a voyage between Alexandria and the Fayoum. Again in l.43 could ἐν τῆι Νικίου be read? Nikios was an important town midway between Naukratis and Memphis. My suggested reading of l. 60 must be wrong, but I suppose it cannot be corrected into ἐπὶ τοῦ Δέλτα. My ἐκ in l. 75 is also wrong and ought to be ἐπὶ.

            <p xml:id="p156" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking through some of the Hamburg papyri I came upon a reference to <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/36938">P. Lond. V., 1764</ref>, 4, τὴν τοῦ οἴνου καλλονὴν καὶ παραμονήν. Would you mind telling me if the context shows καλλονήν to mean some process of clarifying the wine, or if some other meaning is indicated. Meyer’s καλλοινήν (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 90</ref>) seems to me rather questionable, and I do not feel much confidence in his transcriptions. He has made nonsense of no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28701">87</ref> by reading Βαιβ̣ίνης instead of the obvious βαροίνῃς (= βαρύνῃς), ‘do not burden yourself with the wedding outfit, but bring a reasonable amount’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn84" n="84"><p style="text-align: justify; "> βαρύνῃς was doubtfully conjectured by Schubart (BL 2.2.75); βαροίνῃς was read on the original much later (BL 13.105).</p></note> In no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">88</ref> again the word which he reads as ἐγαίσησες and which Wilcken amends into ἐγαὶς Ἦσες (= ὑγιὴς Ἦσις) is no doubt ἐγάμησες, as is shown by the phrase in l. 7 καὶ νῦν ὡς ἄνθρωπος τέλειος || γενάμενος ‘and now also that you are a married man’ (Hesych. τέλειοι οἱ γεγαμηκότες).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn85" n="85"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">P.Hamb. 1 88</ref> was reedited in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 556–562, who read ἐγάμησες on a photograph (BL 5.40). <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 561 accepted Meyer’s legal interpretation of τέλειος.</p></note> So I should not be surprised if he also has gone wrong over καλλοινήν.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn86" n="86"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The passage (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 1 90</ref>.5–7) was read as ὡς ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ π̣ε|ρὶ τοῦ γόμου τοῦ οἴνο̣υ, ἐ̣κλί|σθη καλῶς καὶ τὴν καλλοιν̣[ὴν   ̣  ̣  ̣  ̣] καὶ ἐ̣σφράγισα. The <ref target="http://resolver.sub.uni-hamburg.de/goobi/HANSh817">online image</ref> shows that καλλοι is possible, but there is no word beginning καλλοιν- ; the upright could also belong to nu. After that, there are traces of two letters; καλλον̣ή̣ν̣ is conceivable, but it is difficult to account for the accusative in the sequence. (In l. 5, read ἐνετείλ⟦λ⟧ω μοι  instead of ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ; cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/110132">P.Sijp 9_d</ref>.8.)</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p157" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">There is a difficult phrase in one of the Zenon texts, <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2080">P.S.I. 396</ref>, τῆς προστάδος των καλαίνων οὗ   κε οἶνος κεῖται μου. Surely καλαίνων can mean nothing but the cellars (can it be misread for καμαρίων ?),<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn87" n="87"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Later corrected to καμίνων (BL 3.223).</p></note> and it strikes me as possible that what the writer of Hamb. 90 sealed up was not the wine-jars but the deck-house in which they were loaded.

            <p xml:id="p194" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>.

            <p xml:id="p198" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Bell,</p>
            <p xml:id="p199" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the trouble you have taken about my proofs. It is satisfactory in a negative way to know that none of your fragments can be fitted on.</p>
            <p xml:id="p200" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I observed lately that <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.Cairo</seg> 59415 and <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.S.I.</seg> 376 make up a nearly complete letter from Deinon dated L λϛ Υπερβερε ιζ. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn99" n="99"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The join was noted in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95113">P.Cair.Zen. 4</ref>, p. 289. The two fragments were published together in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1477">P.Cair.Zen. 5 59853</ref>.</p></note> That suggested to me that the Manchester fragment might be part of B. M. 2678, and your transcript rather confirms my suspicion.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn100" n="100"><p style="text-align: justify; "> First published in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34820">Edgar 1934</ref>: 124–125 (no. 12), and then as <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2421">P.Ryl. 4 565</ref>.</p></note> Both fragments have the same number of lines, and in several cases they fit together admirably. L. 8 does not trouble me for it might be restored somewhat like this ὅτι γὰρ π[οιήσομεν δεῖ σε] νοεῖν. The only difficulty is in l. 4, where εἰ δὴ μέν   ought to be εἰδῶμεν and Grenfell’s ]εαιει is not quite intelligible. But his copies were made very rapidly and need to be || revised.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn101" n="101"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34820">Edgar 1934</ref>: 111.</p></note> ἀναλαμβάνων in l. 5 must mean ‘recover’ and the next line ‘and see that you grow strong again’; apparently Zenon had had an illness.</p>
            <p xml:id="p201" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I should much like to see the re-discovered Petrie papyri and hope to have an opportunity some day soon.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn102" n="102"><p style="text-align: justify; "> It is unclear what these papyri were. One possibility is Petrie’s Ptolemaic cartonnage now kept at University College London; cf. P.Pintaudi 17 (esp. p. 78 and n. 10).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p205" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Thanks for the hand copy, which accords with Grenfell’s note ‘fine large hand’. I feel little doubt about the identification. ειδημεν is not a mistake for ειδωμεν or ειδησωμεν, but the pluperfect (for the form see P.S.I 445,15).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn103" n="103"><p style="text-align: justify; "> PSI 4 445 was republished in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1274">P.Cair.Zen. 4 59643</ref>.

            <p xml:id="p210" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Hunt has promised to do a volume (or two) of selections from the papyri for the Loeb series, but as he finds it a burden on his other work I have undertaken to do the transcriptions, translations etc, leaving the general selection to him. I feel ill qualified for the task and not very keen about it, but it is evidently desirable that he should be free to get on with his proper work; there || is no one living so good all round as he is. The little that I have done as yet makes me feel that there is a good deal to be done in the verification of readings even in well-known texts, and I should like some time to revise some of those in the B.M.</p>

            <p xml:id="p231" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Mr. Bell,</p>
            <p xml:id="p232" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for your letter and postcard. It was very kind of you to send me these chronological notes, and I am very glad to know what the B.M. collection contains in the way of evidence concerning the different systems of dating. </p>
            <p xml:id="p233" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">In no. 2088 I wonder if it is possible to restore  λ Δαισίου ια, Παῦνι ια .<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn13" n="13"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1530">P.Lond. 7 1967</ref>. The date appears in the edition as ̣ λ̣α̣, Δ̣α̣ι̣σ̣ί[ο]υ̣ ι̣  ̣, Π̣αῦνι ια (l. 7), with the note that ‘Δαισίου ια could be read’.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p234" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If the date of no. 2097 is year 39, Phamenoth 10 (and not year 35),<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn14" n="14"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1570">P.Lond. 7 2008</ref>. The year is also read as 39 in the edition. </p></note> an interesting question is raised. On the generally accepted chronology (which I see no reason for disputing), Ptolemy II died in the early spring of his 39th canonical or Egyptian year, several months before Phamenoth 10. But the date \of 2097/ may quite well refer to the financial year,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn15" n="15"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The edition also takes it to be the financial year.</p></note> for some new evidence has come to light that the financial year began in Mecheir, in the reign of Ptolemy II as well as Ptolemy III. So Phamenoth of financial year 39 would be equivalent to Phamenoth of the 38th Egyptian year and (I think, but this is more doubtful) to Phamenoth of the 37th Macedonian year. Why is it that while so many papyri are dated year 39 of Ptolemy II and year 2 of Ptolemy III, scarcely any belong to year 1 (see the index to P. Hib. and P. Petrie)?<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn16" n="16"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/54529">Pestman et al. 1981</ref>: 198. </p></note> It may be a mere accident, but I think a more probable explanation is that a large number of papyri || are dated by the financial year, and the financial year 1 of Euergetes was extremely short, not more than a month and a half.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn17" n="17"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar offers a synthesis on ‘the problem of dating’ in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, pp. 50–57. The conclusion (p. 55) does not differ from his views expressed in this letter. On the chronology in the Zenon papyri, see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/54529">Pestman et al. 1981</ref>: 215–222, which however is not the definitive account; cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/79269">Bennett 2011</ref>.</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p254" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The papyrus containing the epigrams has now been photographed, but I am afraid the photo is a little smaller than the original.

            <p xml:id="p255" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The text is more fully preserved than the photograph might lead you to think, for some letters which are lost or nearly illegible on the <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">recto</seg> have left quite clear impressions on the <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">verso</seg>.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn26" n="26"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar 1918b: 173 records the first case of mirror writing in a Zenon papyrus; see in general <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/81466">D’Alessio 2012</ref>: 296–298 (we owe the reference to D.

            <p xml:id="p256" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I have one or two corrections to make. In l. 6, which has to be deciphered from the <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">verso</seg>, the first word is probably [λ]ό̣χμα̣ι̣ς̣.

We may possibly get another collection of fragments, but it is doubtful; like most European Museums we are in very low water.</p>

In any case your new fragment not only enables us to understand my no. 11 with greater exactness, but also explains a thing which had puzzled me. Besides no. 11<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn39" n="39"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/718">P.Cair.Zen. 1 59060</ref>.</p></note> we have another letter<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn40" n="40"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/719">P.Cair.Zen. 1 59061</ref>.</p></note> from Hierokles, received on the 2nd of Xandikos || and giving the gist of the second half of no. 11. Your no. 2312 now gives the gist of the first half. Something of this sort seems to have happened. Hierokles wrote no. 11 first, found it not quite satisfactory, and wrote the other two letters instead of it. But by some mistake no. 11 was sent to Zenon as well as the other two; perhaps by a different messenger, as it arrived a day later. I infer that no. 11 was the rejected copy from the fact that it is less correctly expressed. See especially the phrase in l. 2: ἔγραψάς μοι εἰ μὲν ἀκρειβῶς ἐπιστάμεθα ἀλείφειν αὐτόν    . As the words stand this means ‘you told us to train him if we know exactly how to do so’. But the new letter shows that Hierokles meant to say ‘if we are perfectly sure that he will win’. Incidentally it makes two other points quite clear, 1) that Pyrrhos was being trained to compete in the games and 2) that Hierokles wrote from Alexandria (see the expression καταγαγηις in l.11).</p>

            <p xml:id="p300" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">With regard to the other fragment I remember, but cannot at the moment lay my hand on, a papyrus of ours in which there is mention of honey having been delivered to an Asklepiades. So I should say that the entry on the || verso of your fragment is certainly connected with the recto and should read something like this </p>
            <p xml:id="p301" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">παρα (or παρ’) and then some proper name (Αρτεμιδωρου?)</p>

            <p xml:id="p303" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If we find that we have each a number of fragments which would complete some of the papyri in our respective collections, would Br.

We have already exchanged some fragments with Florence, to the advantage of both collections; and it seems to me a very commendable practice. </p>

            <p xml:id="p314" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">	They are for the most part unrevised copies and no doubt contain many errors, especially among the letters next to the breaks.

The measurements are in centimetres and millimetres, height and width; || and by height I mean the height of the recto of the document, quite irrespective of the direction of the fibres. ‘Written along’ a ‘written horizontally’ means that the writing is in line with the fibres; ‘written across’ means that it is at right angles to them.</p>

            <p xml:id="p349" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I saw Hunt last week and spoke to him about the bibliography but he was already in communication with you and was trying to find you a collaborator. Let us hope he will succeed.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn64" n="64"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Hunt had written to Bell on 31 July 1927 (BL Add. MS 59512, f. 176): ‘Segrè might be tried for bibliography if no one else at home can be got, but he always strikes me as rather inaccurate and I should prefer an Englishman if one can be found. I can’t say why || J.G. Milne won’t: he has plenty of time, surely. Another possibility occurs to me in C.C. Edgar who has just left Egypt for good. I should imagine that he is likely to settle somewhere within reach of books. He wrote lately that he hopes to be in Oxford shortly and would like to see me, so I could mention it if you like.’ Bell had been responsible for compiling the bibliography for Graeco-Roman Egypt in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> since 1914. The instalment published in 1927 was signed by three contributors (Bell et al. 1927), with a note by Bell explaining the background. His promotion to Deputy Keeper in 1927 increased the difficulty of the task. The next instalment was the work of eight contributors (Milne et al. 1928); J.G. Milne was among them, but not Edgar (or Segrè). Edgar only contributed the section on ‘Publications of non-literary texts’ in the bibliography for 1932–1933 (Milne et al. 1934: 88–92), replacing Bell.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p350" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">At present I am compiling the Index to my catalogue, a long but unavoidable piece of drudgery, but I hope to come next week to the B.M., Tuesday or Wednesday, and put in a few || hours on the Michigan papyri. It is good news that your Ptolemaic volume is now in prospect.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn65" n="65"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell (1927a: 1) noted that ‘vol. VI of the Catalogue, … will, it is hoped, contain all the Ptolemaic papyri acquired since 1906’. This had been the plan for some time (‘Volume VI of the Museum Catalogue is likely to consist entirely of Ptolemaic texts.’ [Bell 1922: 100]), and this remained the case in the years that followed (‘vol. VI … will consist entirely of Ptolemaic papyri’ [<ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34376">Bell 1933</ref>: 514]). The project was subsequently handed over to T. C. Skeat, and the volume was numbered VII. </p></note></p>

It is true that several Ptolemaic papyri <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">not</seg> found in Zenon’s archive have been sold as part of it. It is true also that the name of Zenon continued to be prominent in Philadelphia after our Zenon’s death, like that of his partner Sostratos (see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95152">Partsch - Wilcken, Jur.

            <p xml:id="p363" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I have not yet gone through the text very carefully but there is one suggestion which I cannot refrain from making. In l. 14 is it not possible to read ἐν] Ναυ[κρ]άτι ? If that is right, the tablets are probably an account of a voyage between Alexandria and the Fayoum. Again in l.43 could ἐν τῆι Νικίου be read? Nikios was an important town midway between Naukratis and Memphis. My suggested reading of l. 60 must be wrong, but I suppose it cannot be corrected into ἐπὶ τοῦ Δέλτα. My ἐκ in l. 75 is also wrong and ought to be ἐπὶ.

            <p xml:id="p379" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking through some of the Hamburg papyri I came upon a reference to <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/36938">P. Lond.

Meyer’s καλλοινήν (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 90</ref>) seems to me rather questionable, and I do not feel much confidence in his transcriptions. He has made nonsense of no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28701">87</ref> by reading Βαιβ̣ίνης instead of the obvious βαροίνῃς (= βαρύνῃς), ‘do not burden yourself with the wedding outfit, but bring a reasonable amount’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn84" n="84"><p style="text-align: justify; "> βαρύνῃς was doubtfully conjectured by Schubart (BL 2.2.75); βαροίνῃς was read on the original much later (BL 13.105).</p></note> In no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">88</ref> again the word which he reads as ἐγαίσησες and which Wilcken amends into ἐγαὶς Ἦσες (= ὑγιὴς Ἦσις) is no doubt ἐγάμησες, as is shown by the phrase in l. 7 καὶ νῦν ὡς ἄνθρωπος τέλειος || γενάμενος ‘and now also that you are a married man’ (Hesych. τέλειοι οἱ γεγαμηκότες).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn85" n="85"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">P.Hamb. 1 88</ref> was reedited in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 556–562, who read ἐγάμησες on a photograph (BL 5.40). <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 561 accepted Meyer’s legal interpretation of τέλειος.</p></note> So I should not be surprised if he also has gone wrong over καλλοινήν.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn86" n="86"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The passage (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 1 90</ref>.5–7) was read as ὡς ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ π̣ε|ρὶ τοῦ γόμου τοῦ οἴνο̣υ, ἐ̣κλί|σθη καλῶς καὶ τὴν καλλοιν̣[ὴν   ̣  ̣  ̣  ̣] καὶ ἐ̣σφράγισα. The <ref target="http://resolver.sub.uni-hamburg.de/goobi/HANSh817">online image</ref> shows that καλλοι is possible, but there is no word beginning καλλοιν- ; the upright could also belong to nu. After that, there are traces of two letters; καλλον̣ή̣ν̣ is conceivable, but it is difficult to account for the accusative in the sequence.

            <p xml:id="p380" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">There is a difficult phrase in one of the Zenon texts, <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2080">P.S.I. 396</ref>, τῆς προστάδος των καλαίνων οὗ   κε οἶνος κεῖται μου.

            <p xml:id="p411" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking up the passages in which ἐνοχλεῖσθαι is used of animals, I came across a curious phrase in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7495">P.Petrie II, no. 25 (a)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον ἐνοχλούμενον ἐγλοηθέν  θατα. In P.Petrie III Smyly quotes Mayser to the effect that ἐγλοηθέντα = ἐγλογηθέντα, ‘ausgeschieden’. The phrase recurs in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7496">P.P. II, no. 25 (b)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον \ἐνοχλούμενον/ ἐγλοηθέντα καὶ φλεβοτομηθέντα, but in the facsimile it seems to me that the word is clearly ἐγλουσθέντα, ‘after having received a drench and been bled.’ If you have time one day, could you verify on the originals (B.M. DLIX–X<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn96" n="96"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The actual inventory numbers are DLVIII–DLIX (558–559).</p></note>) whether my reading is right.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn97" n="97"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell pencilled, ‘probably’. Mayser’s interpretation, quoted in P.Petr. 3 61b, had also been questioned by Wilcken, who suggested that ἐγλοηθέντα stands for ἐκλουθέντα (Wilcken 1906: 519 = BL 1.360).</p></note> Mayser’s explanation strikes me as very far-fetched.</p>

            <p xml:id="p416" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind giving me an impartial opinion on the following point?</p>
            <p xml:id="p417" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>. The latter course would be simpler and would improve the make-up of the book. The former course would necessitate the transference of the note from the preliminary matter \(in which it is out of scale)/ to a place between the Introduction and the Texts. But is the information which it gives about the form of a typical Ptolemaic letter of sufficient interest to justify a departure from the ordinary arrangement? Or do you think that to any likely reader the information is superfluous? ||</p>
            <p xml:id="p418" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I am in doubt myself and should in any case attach more weight to your opinion than to my own in a question of this sort.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn98" n="98"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar ultimately opted for the ‘former course’; see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, pp. 58–60 (‘The form of the papyri and the method of publication’).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p423" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I observed lately that <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.Cairo</seg> 59415 and <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.S.I.</seg> 376 make up a nearly complete letter from Deinon dated L λϛ Υπερβερε ιζ. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn99" n="99"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The join was noted in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95113">P.Cair.Zen. 4</ref>, p. 289.

            <p xml:id="p469" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The papyrus containing the epigrams has now been photographed, but I am afraid the photo is a little smaller than the original. The actual dimensions of the text are: height 26½ cm., greatest width 20 cm. I have told the photographer to send the negative and a print direct to Gilson.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn25" n="25"><p style="text-align: justify; "> J. P. Gilson (1868–1929) was Keeper of Manuscripts in the British Museum.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p470" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The text is more fully preserved than the photograph might lead you to think, for some letters which are lost or nearly illegible on the <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">recto</seg> have left quite clear impressions on the <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">verso</seg>.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn26" n="26"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar 1918b: 173 records the first case of mirror writing in a Zenon papyrus; see in general <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/81466">D’Alessio 2012</ref>: 296–298 (we owe the reference to D. Kaltsas).</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p471" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I have one or two corrections to make. In l. 6, which has to be deciphered from the <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">verso</seg>, the first word is probably [λ]ό̣χμα̣ι̣ς̣. Instead of ἀμ̣ε̣ρ̣γόμενος read ἀμ̣εργόμενος, for ερ is quite distinct on the verso. || In l. 10 I think I can read (again from the <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">verso</seg>) [ο]ὐκ̣ ἀ̣ν̣έμυσεν, but I am not quite sure. In l. 14 read σ⟦κκ⟧ύλαξ.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn27" n="27"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar’s new reading in l. 10 is alluded to in Wilcken 1920: 454. The corrections to ll. 6 ([λ]ό̣χμα̣ι̣ς̣) and 10 were reported in Wilcken 1924:80. The corrections to lines 6 and 14 were incorporated in <ref target="https://papyri.info/dclp/65682">P.Cair.Zen. 4 59532</ref>, but Edgar read οὐ πρ[ὶ]ν̣ ἔμυσεν in l. 10.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p472" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If there is any other information I can give you or any other readings that you would like to have verified on the original, please let me know. </p>

Though I hope to be in England shortly, I do not wish to carry antiquities out of Egypt, so I am going to send it to you after getting the Museum permit and paying the customs dues.

Bell dated 25 June 1921 (in BL Add. MS 89298) relates the following: ‘Under date of June 12th Mr C.C. Edgar wrote to me that he has sent to you for me a papyrus which Dr. Grenfell selected last year but which I had no time to acquire before leaving Cairo. Mr White obtained it for me, and delivered it to Mr Edgar, who kept it at the Museum. This is paid for independently, and if you will be good enough to keep it for me till I go to London it will be an additional favour.’</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p486" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Mr. Bell, </p>
            <p xml:id="p487" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for your interesting letter, which I have just received. Yes, I called on you at the British Museum in September, but found you were away on leave. Perhaps I may be more fortunate next summer. The fine Zenon papyri which you mention were offered to us indirectly last spring, but the price asked was far beyond our resources. We may possibly get another collection of fragments, but it is doubtful; like most European Museums we are in very low water.</p>

If I am right, the first two lines will read pretty nearly as follows: Ιεροκλης Ζηνωνι χαιρειν. ει ερρω[σαι τε τωι σωματι και εστι σου τα] αλλα [κατα γνωμην], καλως αν εχοι· υγιαινω δε και αυτο[ς. περι του παιδαριου εγραψας μο]ι, ει με[ν επισταμεθα] ακριβως οτι νικησει, αλειφειν, ει δε μη,                 [. In any case your new fragment not only enables us to understand my no. 11 with greater exactness, but also explains a thing which had puzzled me. Besides no. 11<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn39" n="39"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/718">P.Cair.Zen. 1 59060</ref>.</p></note> we have another letter<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn40" n="40"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/719">P.Cair.Zen. 1 59061</ref>.</p></note> from Hierokles, received on the 2nd of Xandikos || and giving the gist of the second half of no. 11. Your no. 2312 now gives the gist of the first half. Something of this sort seems to have happened. Hierokles wrote no. 11 first, found it not quite satisfactory, and wrote the other two letters instead of it. But by some mistake no. 11 was sent to Zenon as well as the other two; perhaps by a different messenger, as it arrived a day later. I infer that no. 11 was the rejected copy from the fact that it is less correctly expressed. See especially the phrase in l. 2: ἔγραψάς μοι εἰ μὲν ἀκρειβῶς ἐπιστάμεθα ἀλείφειν αὐτόν    . As the words stand this means ‘you told us to train him if we know exactly how to do so’. But the new letter shows that Hierokles meant to say ‘if we are perfectly sure that he will win’. Incidentally it makes two other points quite clear, 1) that Pyrrhos was being trained to compete in the games and 2) that Hierokles wrote from Alexandria (see the expression καταγαγηις in l.11).</p>

            <p xml:id="p515" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">With regard to the other fragment I remember, but cannot at the moment lay my hand on, a papyrus of ours in which there is mention of honey having been delivered to an Asklepiades. So I should say that the entry on the || verso of your fragment is certainly connected with the recto and should read something like this </p>
            <p xml:id="p516" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">παρα (or παρ’) and then some proper name (Αρτεμιδωρου?)</p>

            <p xml:id="p518" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If we find that we have each a number of fragments which would complete some of the papyri in our respective collections, would Br. Mus. be willing to make an exchange? There would be no difficulty on our side, but you may perhaps be bound to stricter rules. We have already exchanged some fragments with Florence, to the advantage of both collections; and it seems to me a very commendable practice. </p>

            <p xml:id="p529" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">	They are for the most part unrevised copies and no doubt contain many errors, especially among the letters next to the breaks.

            <p xml:id="p558" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Kelsey has just written to say that he is leaving for England about the 14th, that he is bringing over the new lot of Zenon papyri so that I can copy them in the Br. Mus. and that he hopes to meet me there. But as I am leaving on the morning of the 23rd it is scarcely likely that I shall be able to see him in London. Probably, however, he will be willing to leave the papyri in the B.M. until my return next summer, if you have no objection. It is much more satisfactory to copy from the originals than from photographs.</p>

            <p xml:id="p564" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I saw Hunt last week and spoke to him about the bibliography but he was already in communication with you and was trying to find you a collaborator. Let us hope he will succeed.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn64" n="64"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Hunt had written to Bell on 31 July 1927 (BL Add. MS 59512, f. 176): ‘Segrè might be tried for bibliography if no one else at home can be got, but he always strikes me as rather inaccurate and I should prefer an Englishman if one can be found. I can’t say why || J.G. Milne won’t: he has plenty of time, surely. Another possibility occurs to me in C.C. Edgar who has just left Egypt for good. I should imagine that he is likely to settle somewhere within reach of books. He wrote lately that he hopes to be in Oxford shortly and would like to see me, so I could mention it if you like.’ Bell had been responsible for compiling the bibliography for Graeco-Roman Egypt in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> since 1914. The instalment published in 1927 was signed by three contributors (Bell et al. 1927), with a note by Bell explaining the background. His promotion to Deputy Keeper in 1927 increased the difficulty of the task. The next instalment was the work of eight contributors (Milne et al. 1928); J.G. Milne was among them, but not Edgar (or Segrè). Edgar only contributed the section on ‘Publications of non-literary texts’ in the bibliography for 1932–1933 (Milne et al. 1934: 88–92), replacing Bell.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p565" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">At present I am compiling the Index to my catalogue, a long but unavoidable piece of drudgery, but I hope to come next week to the B.M., Tuesday or Wednesday, and put in a few || hours on the Michigan papyri. It is good news that your Ptolemaic volume is now in prospect.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn65" n="65"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell (1927a: 1) noted that ‘vol. VI of the Catalogue, … will, it is hoped, contain all the Ptolemaic papyri acquired since 1906’. This had been the plan for some time (‘Volume VI of the Museum Catalogue is likely to consist entirely of Ptolemaic texts.’ [Bell 1922: 100]), and this remained the case in the years that followed (‘vol. VI … will consist entirely of Ptolemaic papyri’ [<ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34376">Bell 1933</ref>: 514]). The project was subsequently handed over to T. C.

Nikios was an important town midway between Naukratis and Memphis. My suggested reading of l. 60 must be wrong, but I suppose it cannot be corrected into ἐπὶ τοῦ Δέλτα.

            <p xml:id="p600" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If the Petrie papyrus DXX (= <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7650">P.Petr.

The word in l. 4 which I read with some hesitation as στομ̣ωτ̣ήν would probably give a clue to the meaning if correctly deciphered.

            <p xml:id="p626" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking up the passages in which ἐνοχλεῖσθαι is used of animals, I came across a curious phrase in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7495">P.Petrie II, no. 25 (a)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον ἐνοχλούμενον ἐγλοηθέν  θατα.

II, no. 25 (b)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον \ἐνοχλούμενον/ ἐγλοηθέντα καὶ φλεβοτομηθέντα, but in the facsimile it seems to me that the word is clearly ἐγλουσθέντα, ‘after having received a drench and been bled.’ If you have time one day, could you verify on the originals (B.M.

            <p xml:id="p631" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind giving me an impartial opinion on the following point?</p>
            <p xml:id="p632" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>. The latter course would be simpler and would improve the make-up of the book. The former course would necessitate the transference of the note from the preliminary matter \(in which it is out of scale)/ to a place between the Introduction and the Texts. But is the information which it gives about the form of a typical Ptolemaic letter of sufficient interest to justify a departure from the ordinary arrangement? Or do you think that to any likely reader the information is superfluous? ||</p>

            <p xml:id="p661" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind verifying a reading in the letter which you published in Archiv VI, p.102?<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn110" n="110"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell 1913: 102.

Is it quite clear or would it be possible to read τὸ δ’? If τοῦ is certain Hunt suggests ἐπιλ[έξαντος in l. 8, which would do equally well and  obviate the necessity of supposing τοῦ to be a mistake of the scribe for καί.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn111" n="111"><p style="text-align: justify; "> ἐπιλ[έξαντος was printed in Sel.

            <p xml:id="p665" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the off print of your reviews. Hasn’t Boak misunderstood the construction of ll. 9-10 of the edict? It would give better grammar to read [ὧν] in l. 9<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn112" n="112"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34390">Boak 1934</ref>: 1–8, reedited as <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/17375">P.Cair.Isid. 1</ref>, where the passage runs ἀπὸ τοῦ προτεθέντος θείου διατάγματος | καὶ τοῦ αὐτῷ συννηννωμένου βρεουίου [οἷς] τὰ ἀντίγραφα τούτου μου τοῦ διατάγματος | δημοσίᾳ προύταξα, ἔνεστιν κτλ.

Edgar’s proposed emendation, [ὧν] instead of [καί], is recorded in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> 21 (1935) 89, and was also suggested by Wilcken, but the new edition preferred Collomp’s [οἷς].</p></note> and προύταξα, ἔνεστιν πᾶσι εὖ νο[εῖ]  ν in l. 10.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn113" n="113"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/17375">P.Cair.Isid. 1</ref>.10 n. records εὖ νο[εῖ]ν as a suggestiom by Lewis.</p></note></p>

Grenfell seems to have transcribed almost everything<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn115" n="115"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Grenfell’s input is mentioned in the preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3137">P.Tebt. III.1</ref>, but not exactly in these terms. It would be fair to say that without Grenfell’s transcriptions there would have been no P.Tebt. III.1–2.</p></note> and a great deal of work has been done by Hunt and Smyly also. A fair amount of commentary has already been written. Besides this material there || is a large packet of papyri which rather embarrasses me. I doubt whether it would be better to bring it all to the B.M. and take out what I need from time to time or to work through it here and deposit it with you in instalments. Probably the latter method would be better as some of the material is very fragile and might be injured by being carried backwards and forwards.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn116" n="116"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3740">P.Tebt. III.2</ref> reports that ‘Early in 1935 the papyri were removed from Oxford and temporarily stored in the British Museum’.</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p678" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The papyrus containing the epigrams has now been photographed, but I am afraid the photo is a little smaller than the original. The actual dimensions of the text are: height 26½ cm., greatest width 20 cm. I have told the photographer to send the negative and a print direct to Gilson.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn25" n="25"><p style="text-align: justify; "> J. P. Gilson (1868–1929) was Keeper of Manuscripts in the British Museum.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p679" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The text is more fully preserved than the photograph might lead you to think, for some letters which are lost or nearly illegible on the <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">recto</seg> have left quite clear impressions on the <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">verso</seg>.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn26" n="26"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar 1918b: 173 records the first case of mirror writing in a Zenon papyrus; see in general <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/81466">D’Alessio 2012</ref>: 296–298 (we owe the reference to D. Kaltsas).</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p680" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I have one or two corrections to make. In l. 6, which has to be deciphered from the <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">verso</seg>, the first word is probably [λ]ό̣χμα̣ι̣ς̣. Instead of ἀμ̣ε̣ρ̣γόμενος read ἀμ̣εργόμενος, for ερ is quite distinct on the verso. || In l. 10 I think I can read (again from the <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">verso</seg>) [ο]ὐκ̣ ἀ̣ν̣έμυσεν, but I am not quite sure. In l. 14 read σ⟦κκ⟧ύλαξ.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn27" n="27"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar’s new reading in l. 10 is alluded to in Wilcken 1920: 454. The corrections to ll. 6 ([λ]ό̣χμα̣ι̣ς̣) and 10 were reported in Wilcken 1924:80. The corrections to lines 6 and 14 were incorporated in <ref target="https://papyri.info/dclp/65682">P.Cair.Zen. 4 59532</ref>, but Edgar read οὐ πρ[ὶ]ν̣ ἔμυσεν in l. 10.</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p695" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Mr. Bell, </p>
            <p xml:id="p696" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for your interesting letter, which I have just received. Yes, I called on you at the British Museum in September, but found you were away on leave. Perhaps I may be more fortunate next summer. The fine Zenon papyri which you mention were offered to us indirectly last spring, but the price asked was far beyond our resources. We may possibly get another collection of fragments, but it is doubtful; like most European Museums we are in very low water.</p>
            <p xml:id="p697" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If your no. 2312<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn36" n="36"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2384">P.Lond. 7 1941</ref>.</p></note> is between 120 and 125<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn37" n="37"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell pencilled ‘124 mm’; the height is given as 12.5 cm in the edition.</p></note> mill. high, I believe that we have a fragment of the same letter.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn38" n="38"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Transcribed in the next letter.</p></note> I will send you my copy as soon as I have revised it on the original, but the Museum is shut until the 13th. If I am right, the first two lines will read pretty nearly as follows: Ιεροκλης Ζηνωνι χαιρειν. ει ερρω[σαι τε τωι σωματι και εστι σου τα] αλλα [κατα γνωμην], καλως αν εχοι· υγιαινω δε και αυτο[ς. περι του παιδαριου εγραψας μο]ι, ει με[ν επισταμεθα] ακριβως οτι νικησει, αλειφειν, ει δε μη,                 [.

Your no. 2312 now gives the gist of the first half. Something of this sort seems to have happened. Hierokles wrote no. 11 first, found it not quite satisfactory, and wrote the other two letters instead of it. But by some mistake no. 11 was sent to Zenon as well as the other two; perhaps by a different messenger, as it arrived a day later. I infer that no. 11 was the rejected copy from the fact that it is less correctly expressed. See especially the phrase in l. 2: ἔγραψάς μοι εἰ μὲν ἀκρειβῶς ἐπιστάμεθα ἀλείφειν αὐτόν    . As the words stand this means ‘you told us to train him if we know exactly how to do so’. But the new letter shows that Hierokles meant to say ‘if we are perfectly sure that he will win’. Incidentally it makes two other points quite clear, 1) that Pyrrhos was being trained to compete in the games and 2) that Hierokles wrote from Alexandria (see the expression καταγαγηις in l.11).</p>

We have already exchanged some fragments with Florence, to the advantage of both collections; and it seems to me a very commendable practice. </p>

            <p xml:id="p738" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">	They are for the most part unrevised copies and no doubt contain many errors, especially among the letters next to the breaks.

            <p xml:id="p767" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Kelsey has just written to say that he is leaving for England about the 14th, that he is bringing over the new lot of Zenon papyri so that I can copy them in the Br.

            <p xml:id="p773" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I saw Hunt last week and spoke to him about the bibliography but he was already in communication with you and was trying to find you a collaborator. Let us hope he will succeed.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn64" n="64"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Hunt had written to Bell on 31 July 1927 (BL Add. MS 59512, f. 176): ‘Segrè might be tried for bibliography if no one else at home can be got, but he always strikes me as rather inaccurate and I should prefer an Englishman if one can be found. I can’t say why || J.G. Milne won’t: he has plenty of time, surely. Another possibility occurs to me in C.C. Edgar who has just left Egypt for good. I should imagine that he is likely to settle somewhere within reach of books. He wrote lately that he hopes to be in Oxford shortly and would like to see me, so I could mention it if you like.’ Bell had been responsible for compiling the bibliography for Graeco-Roman Egypt in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> since 1914. The instalment published in 1927 was signed by three contributors (Bell et al. 1927), with a note by Bell explaining the background. His promotion to Deputy Keeper in 1927 increased the difficulty of the task. The next instalment was the work of eight contributors (Milne et al. 1928); J.G. Milne was among them, but not Edgar (or Segrè). Edgar only contributed the section on ‘Publications of non-literary texts’ in the bibliography for 1932–1933 (Milne et al. 1934: 88–92), replacing Bell.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p774" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">At present I am compiling the Index to my catalogue, a long but unavoidable piece of drudgery, but I hope to come next week to the B.M., Tuesday or Wednesday, and put in a few || hours on the Michigan papyri. It is good news that your Ptolemaic volume is now in prospect.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn65" n="65"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell (1927a: 1) noted that ‘vol. VI of the Catalogue, … will, it is hoped, contain all the Ptolemaic papyri acquired since 1906’. This had been the plan for some time (‘Volume VI of the Museum Catalogue is likely to consist entirely of Ptolemaic texts.’ [Bell 1922: 100]), and this remained the case in the years that followed (‘vol. VI … will consist entirely of Ptolemaic papyri’ [<ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34376">Bell 1933</ref>: 514]). The project was subsequently handed over to T. C.

            <p xml:id="p803" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking through some of the Hamburg papyri I came upon a reference to <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/36938">P. Lond. V., 1764</ref>, 4, τὴν τοῦ οἴνου καλλονὴν καὶ παραμονήν. Would you mind telling me if the context shows καλλονήν to mean some process of clarifying the wine, or if some other meaning is indicated. Meyer’s καλλοινήν (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 90</ref>) seems to me rather questionable, and I do not feel much confidence in his transcriptions. He has made nonsense of no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28701">87</ref> by reading Βαιβ̣ίνης instead of the obvious βαροίνῃς (= βαρύνῃς), ‘do not burden yourself with the wedding outfit, but bring a reasonable amount’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn84" n="84"><p style="text-align: justify; "> βαρύνῃς was doubtfully conjectured by Schubart (BL 2.2.75); βαροίνῃς was read on the original much later (BL 13.105).</p></note> In no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">88</ref> again the word which he reads as ἐγαίσησες and which Wilcken amends into ἐγαὶς Ἦσες (= ὑγιὴς Ἦσις) is no doubt ἐγάμησες, as is shown by the phrase in l. 7 καὶ νῦν ὡς ἄνθρωπος τέλειος || γενάμενος ‘and now also that you are a married man’ (Hesych. τέλειοι οἱ γεγαμηκότες).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn85" n="85"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">P.Hamb. 1 88</ref> was reedited in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 556–562, who read ἐγάμησες on a photograph (BL 5.40). <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 561 accepted Meyer’s legal interpretation of τέλειος.</p></note> So I should not be surprised if he also has gone wrong over καλλοινήν.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn86" n="86"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The passage (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 1 90</ref>.5–7) was read as ὡς ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ π̣ε|ρὶ τοῦ γόμου τοῦ οἴνο̣υ, ἐ̣κλί|σθη καλῶς καὶ τὴν καλλοιν̣[ὴν   ̣  ̣  ̣  ̣] καὶ ἐ̣σφράγισα. The <ref target="http://resolver.sub.uni-hamburg.de/goobi/HANSh817">online image</ref> shows that καλλοι is possible, but there is no word beginning καλλοιν- ; the upright could also belong to nu. After that, there are traces of two letters; καλλον̣ή̣ν̣ is conceivable, but it is difficult to account for the accusative in the sequence. (In l. 5, read ἐνετείλ⟦λ⟧ω μοι  instead of ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ; cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/110132">P.Sijp 9_d</ref>.8.)</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p804" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">There is a difficult phrase in one of the Zenon texts, <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2080">P.S.I. 396</ref>, τῆς προστάδος των καλαίνων οὗ   κε οἶνος κεῖται μου.

            <p xml:id="p809" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If the Petrie papyrus DXX (= <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7650">P.Petr.

The word in l. 4 which I read with some hesitation as στομ̣ωτ̣ήν would probably give a clue to the meaning if correctly deciphered. If στομωτήν is right, the object of χορηγεῖν would naturally be σκαφεῖα. Enclosed is a very provisional attempt at a restoration.</p>

            <p xml:id="p835" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking up the passages in which ἐνοχλεῖσθαι is used of animals, I came across a curious phrase in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7495">P.Petrie II, no. 25 (a)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον ἐνοχλούμενον ἐγλοηθέν  θατα.

            <p xml:id="p841" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>. The latter course would be simpler and would improve the make-up of the book. The former course would necessitate the transference of the note from the preliminary matter \(in which it is out of scale)/ to a place between the Introduction and the Texts. But is the information which it gives about the form of a typical Ptolemaic letter of sufficient interest to justify a departure from the ordinary arrangement?

            <p xml:id="p857" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Hunt has promised to do a volume (or two) of selections from the papyri for the Loeb series, but as he finds it a burden on his other work I have undertaken to do the transcriptions, translations etc, leaving the general selection to him. I feel ill qualified for the task and not very keen about it, but it is evidently desirable that he should be free to get on with his proper work; there || is no one living so good all round as he is. The little that I have done as yet makes me feel that there is a good deal to be done in the verification of readings even in well-known texts, and I should like some time to revise some of those in the B.M.</p>

            <p xml:id="p874" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the off print of your reviews. Hasn’t Boak misunderstood the construction of ll. 9-10 of the edict? It would give better grammar to read [ὧν] in l. 9<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn112" n="112"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34390">Boak 1934</ref>: 1–8, reedited as <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/17375">P.Cair.Isid. 1</ref>, where the passage runs ἀπὸ τοῦ προτεθέντος θείου διατάγματος | καὶ τοῦ αὐτῷ συννηννωμένου βρεουίου [οἷς] τὰ ἀντίγραφα τούτου μου τοῦ διατάγματος | δημοσίᾳ προύταξα, ἔνεστιν κτλ.

Edgar’s proposed emendation, [ὧν] instead of [καί], is recorded in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> 21 (1935) 89, and was also suggested by Wilcken, but the new edition preferred Collomp’s [οἷς].</p></note> and προύταξα, ἔνεστιν πᾶσι εὖ νο[εῖ]  ν in l. 10.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn113" n="113"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/17375">P.Cair.Isid. 1</ref>.10 n. records εὖ νο[εῖ]ν as a suggestiom by Lewis.</p></note></p>

Grenfell seems to have transcribed almost everything<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn115" n="115"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Grenfell’s input is mentioned in the preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3137">P.Tebt. III.1</ref>, but not exactly in these terms. It would be fair to say that without Grenfell’s transcriptions there would have been no P.Tebt. III.1–2.</p></note> and a great deal of work has been done by Hunt and Smyly also. A fair amount of commentary has already been written. Besides this material there || is a large packet of papyri which rather embarrasses me. I doubt whether it would be better to bring it all to the B.M. and take out what I need from time to time or to work through it here and deposit it with you in instalments. Probably the latter method would be better as some of the material is very fragile and might be injured by being carried backwards and forwards.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn116" n="116"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3740">P.Tebt.

            <p xml:id="p879" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Mr. Bell,</p>
            <p xml:id="p880" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The papyrus containing the epigrams has now been photographed, but I am afraid the photo is a little smaller than the original. The actual dimensions of the text are: height 26½ cm., greatest width 20 cm. I have told the photographer to send the negative and a print direct to Gilson.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn25" n="25"><p style="text-align: justify; "> J. P. Gilson (1868–1929) was Keeper of Manuscripts in the British Museum.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p881" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The text is more fully preserved than the photograph might lead you to think, for some letters which are lost or nearly illegible on the <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">recto</seg> have left quite clear impressions on the <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">verso</seg>.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn26" n="26"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar 1918b: 173 records the first case of mirror writing in a Zenon papyrus; see in general <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/81466">D’Alessio 2012</ref>: 296–298 (we owe the reference to D. Kaltsas).</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p882" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I have one or two corrections to make. In l. 6, which has to be deciphered from the <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">verso</seg>, the first word is probably [λ]ό̣χμα̣ι̣ς̣. Instead of ἀμ̣ε̣ρ̣γόμενος read ἀμ̣εργόμενος, for ερ is quite distinct on the verso. || In l. 10 I think I can read (again from the <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">verso</seg>) [ο]ὐκ̣ ἀ̣ν̣έμυσεν, but I am not quite sure. In l. 14 read σ⟦κκ⟧ύλαξ.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn27" n="27"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar’s new reading in l. 10 is alluded to in Wilcken 1920: 454. The corrections to ll. 6 ([λ]ό̣χμα̣ι̣ς̣) and 10 were reported in Wilcken 1924:80. The corrections to lines 6 and 14 were incorporated in <ref target="https://papyri.info/dclp/65682">P.Cair.Zen. 4 59532</ref>, but Edgar read οὐ πρ[ὶ]ν̣ ἔμυσεν in l. 10.</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p892" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Mr. Bell,</p>
            <p xml:id="p893" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I should have written before now to thank you for the information in your last letter and also for the reprint of your excellent bibliography,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn33" n="33"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell 1921.</p></note> but I have been ill and have only now returned to work.</p>
            <p xml:id="p894" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Last winter Evelyn White<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn34" n="34"><p style="text-align: justify; "> H. G. Evelyn-White (1884–1924).</p></note> bought a long Augustan papyrus for Prof. Kelsey and handed it over to me. White has gone home and Kelsey wants me to take the papyrus to England and give it to you to keep for him, or else send it to you. Though I hope to be in England shortly, I do not wish to carry antiquities out of Egypt, so I am going to send it to you after getting the Museum permit and paying the customs dues. You will no doubt recognise it when it arrives.

The <ref target="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/a/apis/x-7785/">APIS entry</ref> records that the papyrus ‘was forwarded to London by CC Edgar’. A letter of F. W. Kelsey to H. I. Bell dated 25 June 1921 (in BL Add. MS 89298) relates the following: ‘Under date of June 12th Mr C.C. Edgar wrote to me that he has sent to you for me a papyrus which Dr. Grenfell selected last year but which I had no time to acquire before leaving Cairo. Mr White obtained it for me, and delivered it to Mr Edgar, who kept it at the Museum. This is paid for independently, and if you will be good enough to keep it for me till I go to London it will be an additional favour.’</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p896" style="text-align: left; ">Cairo | 11.11.21</p>
            <p xml:id="p897" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Mr. Bell, </p>
            <p xml:id="p898" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for your interesting letter, which I have just received. Yes, I called on you at the British Museum in September, but found you were away on leave. Perhaps I may be more fortunate next summer. The fine Zenon papyri which you mention were offered to us indirectly last spring, but the price asked was far beyond our resources. We may possibly get another collection of fragments, but it is doubtful; like most European Museums we are in very low water.</p>
            <p xml:id="p899" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If your no. 2312<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn36" n="36"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2384">P.Lond. 7 1941</ref>.</p></note> is between 120 and 125<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn37" n="37"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell pencilled ‘124 mm’; the height is given as 12.5 cm in the edition.</p></note> mill. high, I believe that we have a fragment of the same letter.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn38" n="38"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Transcribed in the next letter.</p></note> I will send you my copy as soon as I have revised it on the original, but the Museum is shut until the 13th. If I am right, the first two lines will read pretty nearly as follows: Ιεροκλης Ζηνωνι χαιρειν. ει ερρω[σαι τε τωι σωματι και εστι σου τα] αλλα [κατα γνωμην], καλως αν εχοι· υγιαινω δε και αυτο[ς. περι του παιδαριου εγραψας μο]ι, ει με[ν επισταμεθα] ακριβως οτι νικησει, αλειφειν, ει δε μη,                 [. In any case your new fragment not only enables us to understand my no. 11 with greater exactness, but also explains a thing which had puzzled me. Besides no. 11<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn39" n="39"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/718">P.Cair.Zen. 1 59060</ref>.</p></note> we have another letter<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn40" n="40"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/719">P.Cair.Zen. 1 59061</ref>.</p></note> from Hierokles, received on the 2nd of Xandikos || and giving the gist of the second half of no. 11. Your no. 2312 now gives the gist of the first half. Something of this sort seems to have happened. Hierokles wrote no. 11 first, found it not quite satisfactory, and wrote the other two letters instead of it. But by some mistake no. 11 was sent to Zenon as well as the other two; perhaps by a different messenger, as it arrived a day later. I infer that no. 11 was the rejected copy from the fact that it is less correctly expressed. See especially the phrase in l. 2: ἔγραψάς μοι εἰ μὲν ἀκρειβῶς ἐπιστάμεθα ἀλείφειν αὐτόν    . As the words stand this means ‘you told us to train him if we know exactly how to do so’. But the new letter shows that Hierokles meant to say ‘if we are perfectly sure that he will win’. Incidentally it makes two other points quite clear, 1) that Pyrrhos was being trained to compete in the games and 2) that Hierokles wrote from Alexandria (see the expression καταγαγηις in l.11).</p>

            <p xml:id="p924" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Your notes are always interesting. One of the fragments which you transcribe completes a letter in our collection beginning [Απολλωνιος] Ζηνωνι χαιρειν. μοσχευματα απιων και φυτα οτι [πλειστ]α παρακομισον εγ Μεμφεως  .</p>

            <p xml:id="p926" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">With regard to the other fragment I remember, but cannot at the moment lay my hand on, a papyrus of ours in which there is mention of honey having been delivered to an Asklepiades. So I should say that the entry on the || verso of your fragment is certainly connected with the recto and should read something like this </p>
            <p xml:id="p927" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">παρα (or παρ’) and then some proper name (Αρτεμιδωρου?)</p>

            <p xml:id="p929" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If we find that we have each a number of fragments which would complete some of the papyri in our respective collections, would Br. Mus. be willing to make an exchange? There would be no difficulty on our side, but you may perhaps be bound to stricter rules. We have already exchanged some fragments with Florence, to the advantage of both collections; and it seems to me a very commendable practice. </p>

            <p xml:id="p939" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">	I have prepared a packet of my copies of more than two hundred Zenon fragments, some of which ought surely to complete or be completed by the fragments in the B.M. Instead of sending them through the post I will bring them myself on Tuesday or some other day this week. In case I do not see you I should like to call your attention to the following points:</p>
            <p xml:id="p940" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">	They are for the most part unrevised copies and no doubt contain many errors, especially among the letters next to the breaks. As they are my only copies I should like to have them back before I return to Cairo, say about the 20th of July. The measurements are in centimetres and millimetres, height and width; || and by height I mean the height of the recto of the document, quite irrespective of the direction of the fibres. ‘Written along’ a ‘written horizontally’ means that the writing is in line with the fibres; ‘written across’ means that it is at right angles to them.</p>

            <p xml:id="p969" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Kelsey has just written to say that he is leaving for England about the 14th, that he is bringing over the new lot of Zenon papyri so that I can copy them in the Br.

            <p xml:id="p975" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I saw Hunt last week and spoke to him about the bibliography but he was already in communication with you and was trying to find you a collaborator. Let us hope he will succeed.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn64" n="64"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Hunt had written to Bell on 31 July 1927 (BL Add. MS 59512, f. 176): ‘Segrè might be tried for bibliography if no one else at home can be got, but he always strikes me as rather inaccurate and I should prefer an Englishman if one can be found. I can’t say why || J.G. Milne won’t: he has plenty of time, surely. Another possibility occurs to me in C.C. Edgar who has just left Egypt for good. I should imagine that he is likely to settle somewhere within reach of books. He wrote lately that he hopes to be in Oxford shortly and would like to see me, so I could mention it if you like.’ Bell had been responsible for compiling the bibliography for Graeco-Roman Egypt in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> since 1914. The instalment published in 1927 was signed by three contributors (Bell et al. 1927), with a note by Bell explaining the background. His promotion to Deputy Keeper in 1927 increased the difficulty of the task. The next instalment was the work of eight contributors (Milne et al. 1928); J.G. Milne was among them, but not Edgar (or Segrè). Edgar only contributed the section on ‘Publications of non-literary texts’ in the bibliography for 1932–1933 (Milne et al. 1934: 88–92), replacing Bell.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p976" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">At present I am compiling the Index to my catalogue, a long but unavoidable piece of drudgery, but I hope to come next week to the B.M., Tuesday or Wednesday, and put in a few || hours on the Michigan papyri. It is good news that your Ptolemaic volume is now in prospect.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn65" n="65"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell (1927a: 1) noted that ‘vol. VI of the Catalogue, … will, it is hoped, contain all the Ptolemaic papyri acquired since 1906’. This had been the plan for some time (‘Volume VI of the Museum Catalogue is likely to consist entirely of Ptolemaic texts.’ [Bell 1922: 100]), and this remained the case in the years that followed (‘vol. VI … will consist entirely of Ptolemaic papyri’ [<ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34376">Bell 1933</ref>: 514]). The project was subsequently handed over to T. C.

            <p xml:id="p1005" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking through some of the Hamburg papyri I came upon a reference to <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/36938">P. Lond. V., 1764</ref>, 4, τὴν τοῦ οἴνου καλλονὴν καὶ παραμονήν. Would you mind telling me if the context shows καλλονήν to mean some process of clarifying the wine, or if some other meaning is indicated. Meyer’s καλλοινήν (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 90</ref>) seems to me rather questionable, and I do not feel much confidence in his transcriptions. He has made nonsense of no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28701">87</ref> by reading Βαιβ̣ίνης instead of the obvious βαροίνῃς (= βαρύνῃς), ‘do not burden yourself with the wedding outfit, but bring a reasonable amount’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn84" n="84"><p style="text-align: justify; "> βαρύνῃς was doubtfully conjectured by Schubart (BL 2.2.75); βαροίνῃς was read on the original much later (BL 13.105).</p></note> In no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">88</ref> again the word which he reads as ἐγαίσησες and which Wilcken amends into ἐγαὶς Ἦσες (= ὑγιὴς Ἦσις) is no doubt ἐγάμησες, as is shown by the phrase in l. 7 καὶ νῦν ὡς ἄνθρωπος τέλειος || γενάμενος ‘and now also that you are a married man’ (Hesych. τέλειοι οἱ γεγαμηκότες).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn85" n="85"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">P.Hamb. 1 88</ref> was reedited in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 556–562, who read ἐγάμησες on a photograph (BL 5.40). <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 561 accepted Meyer’s legal interpretation of τέλειος.</p></note> So I should not be surprised if he also has gone wrong over καλλοινήν.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn86" n="86"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The passage (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 1 90</ref>.5–7) was read as ὡς ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ π̣ε|ρὶ τοῦ γόμου τοῦ οἴνο̣υ, ἐ̣κλί|σθη καλῶς καὶ τὴν καλλοιν̣[ὴν   ̣  ̣  ̣  ̣] καὶ ἐ̣σφράγισα. The <ref target="http://resolver.sub.uni-hamburg.de/goobi/HANSh817">online image</ref> shows that καλλοι is possible, but there is no word beginning καλλοιν- ; the upright could also belong to nu. After that, there are traces of two letters; καλλον̣ή̣ν̣ is conceivable, but it is difficult to account for the accusative in the sequence. (In l. 5, read ἐνετείλ⟦λ⟧ω μοι  instead of ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ; cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/110132">P.Sijp 9_d</ref>.8.)</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p1006" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">There is a difficult phrase in one of the Zenon texts, <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2080">P.S.I. 396</ref>, τῆς προστάδος των καλαίνων οὗ   κε οἶνος κεῖται μου. Surely καλαίνων can mean nothing but the cellars (can it be misread for καμαρίων ?),<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn87" n="87"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Later corrected to καμίνων (BL 3.223).</p></note> and it strikes me as possible that what the writer of Hamb. 90 sealed up was not the wine-jars but the deck-house in which they were loaded.

            <p xml:id="p1011" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If the Petrie papyrus DXX (= <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7650">P.Petr.

The word in l. 4 which I read with some hesitation as στομ̣ωτ̣ήν would probably give a clue to the meaning if correctly deciphered. If στομωτήν is right, the object of χορηγεῖν would naturally be σκαφεῖα. Enclosed is a very provisional attempt at a restoration.</p>

            <p xml:id="p1037" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking up the passages in which ἐνοχλεῖσθαι is used of animals, I came across a curious phrase in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7495">P.Petrie II, no. 25 (a)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον ἐνοχλούμενον ἐγλοηθέν  θατα.

II, no. 25 (b)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον \ἐνοχλούμενον/ ἐγλοηθέντα καὶ φλεβοτομηθέντα, but in the facsimile it seems to me that the word is clearly ἐγλουσθέντα, ‘after having received a drench and been bled.’ If you have time one day, could you verify on the originals (B.M.

            <p xml:id="p1042" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind giving me an impartial opinion on the following point?</p>
            <p xml:id="p1043" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>. The latter course would be simpler and would improve the make-up of the book. The former course would necessitate the transference of the note from the preliminary matter \(in which it is out of scale)/ to a place between the Introduction and the Texts. But is the information which it gives about the form of a typical Ptolemaic letter of sufficient interest to justify a departure from the ordinary arrangement?

            <p xml:id="p1059" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Hunt has promised to do a volume (or two) of selections from the papyri for the Loeb series, but as he finds it a burden on his other work I have undertaken to do the transcriptions, translations etc, leaving the general selection to him. I feel ill qualified for the task and not very keen about it, but it is evidently desirable that he should be free to get on with his proper work; there || is no one living so good all round as he is. The little that I have done as yet makes me feel that there is a good deal to be done in the verification of readings even in well-known texts, and I should like some time to revise some of those in the B.M.</p>

            <p xml:id="p1076" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the off print of your reviews. Hasn’t Boak misunderstood the construction of ll. 9-10 of the edict? It would give better grammar to read [ὧν] in l. 9<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn112" n="112"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34390">Boak 1934</ref>: 1–8, reedited as <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/17375">P.Cair.Isid. 1</ref>, where the passage runs ἀπὸ τοῦ προτεθέντος θείου διατάγματος | καὶ τοῦ αὐτῷ συννηννωμένου βρεουίου [οἷς] τὰ ἀντίγραφα τούτου μου τοῦ διατάγματος | δημοσίᾳ προύταξα, ἔνεστιν κτλ.

Edgar’s proposed emendation, [ὧν] instead of [καί], is recorded in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> 21 (1935) 89, and was also suggested by Wilcken, but the new edition preferred Collomp’s [οἷς].</p></note> and προύταξα, ἔνεστιν πᾶσι εὖ νο[εῖ]  ν in l. 10.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn113" n="113"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/17375">P.Cair.Isid. 1</ref>.10 n. records εὖ νο[εῖ]ν as a suggestiom by Lewis.</p></note></p>

Grenfell seems to have transcribed almost everything<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn115" n="115"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Grenfell’s input is mentioned in the preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3137">P.Tebt. III.1</ref>, but not exactly in these terms. It would be fair to say that without Grenfell’s transcriptions there would have been no P.Tebt. III.1–2.</p></note> and a great deal of work has been done by Hunt and Smyly also. A fair amount of commentary has already been written. Besides this material there || is a large packet of papyri which rather embarrasses me. I doubt whether it would be better to bring it all to the B.M. and take out what I need from time to time or to work through it here and deposit it with you in instalments. Probably the latter method would be better as some of the material is very fragile and might be injured by being carried backwards and forwards.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn116" n="116"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3740">P.Tebt.

            <p xml:id="p1087" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I should have written before now to thank you for the information in your last letter and also for the reprint of your excellent bibliography,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn33" n="33"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell 1921.</p></note> but I have been ill and have only now returned to work.</p>

White has gone home and Kelsey wants me to take the papyrus to England and give it to you to keep for him, or else send it to you. Though I hope to be in England shortly, I do not wish to carry antiquities out of Egypt, so I am going to send it to you after getting the Museum permit and paying the customs dues. You will no doubt recognise it when it arrives.

The <ref target="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/a/apis/x-7785/">APIS entry</ref> records that the papyrus ‘was forwarded to London by CC Edgar’. A letter of F. W. Kelsey to H. I. Bell dated 25 June 1921 (in BL Add. MS 89298) relates the following: ‘Under date of June 12th Mr C.C. Edgar wrote to me that he has sent to you for me a papyrus which Dr. Grenfell selected last year but which I had no time to acquire before leaving Cairo. Mr White obtained it for me, and delivered it to Mr Edgar, who kept it at the Museum. This is paid for independently, and if you will be good enough to keep it for me till I go to London it will be an additional favour.’</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p1091" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Mr. Bell, </p>
            <p xml:id="p1092" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for your interesting letter, which I have just received. Yes, I called on you at the British Museum in September, but found you were away on leave. Perhaps I may be more fortunate next summer. The fine Zenon papyri which you mention were offered to us indirectly last spring, but the price asked was far beyond our resources. We may possibly get another collection of fragments, but it is doubtful; like most European Museums we are in very low water.</p>
            <p xml:id="p1093" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If your no. 2312<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn36" n="36"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2384">P.Lond. 7 1941</ref>.</p></note> is between 120 and 125<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn37" n="37"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell pencilled ‘124 mm’; the height is given as 12.5 cm in the edition.</p></note> mill. high, I believe that we have a fragment of the same letter.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn38" n="38"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Transcribed in the next letter.</p></note> I will send you my copy as soon as I have revised it on the original, but the Museum is shut until the 13th. If I am right, the first two lines will read pretty nearly as follows: Ιεροκλης Ζηνωνι χαιρειν. ει ερρω[σαι τε τωι σωματι και εστι σου τα] αλλα [κατα γνωμην], καλως αν εχοι· υγιαινω δε και αυτο[ς. περι του παιδαριου εγραψας μο]ι, ει με[ν επισταμεθα] ακριβως οτι νικησει, αλειφειν, ει δε μη,                 [. In any case your new fragment not only enables us to understand my no. 11 with greater exactness, but also explains a thing which had puzzled me. Besides no. 11<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn39" n="39"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/718">P.Cair.Zen. 1 59060</ref>.</p></note> we have another letter<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn40" n="40"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/719">P.Cair.Zen. 1 59061</ref>.</p></note> from Hierokles, received on the 2nd of Xandikos || and giving the gist of the second half of no. 11. Your no. 2312 now gives the gist of the first half. Something of this sort seems to have happened. Hierokles wrote no. 11 first, found it not quite satisfactory, and wrote the other two letters instead of it. But by some mistake no. 11 was sent to Zenon as well as the other two; perhaps by a different messenger, as it arrived a day later. I infer that no. 11 was the rejected copy from the fact that it is less correctly expressed. See especially the phrase in l. 2: ἔγραψάς μοι εἰ μὲν ἀκρειβῶς ἐπιστάμεθα ἀλείφειν αὐτόν    . As the words stand this means ‘you told us to train him if we know exactly how to do so’. But the new letter shows that Hierokles meant to say ‘if we are perfectly sure that he will win’. Incidentally it makes two other points quite clear, 1) that Pyrrhos was being trained to compete in the games and 2) that Hierokles wrote from Alexandria (see the expression καταγαγηις in l.11).</p>

            <p xml:id="p1118" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Your notes are always interesting. One of the fragments which you transcribe completes a letter in our collection beginning [Απολλωνιος] Ζηνωνι χαιρειν. μοσχευματα απιων και φυτα οτι [πλειστ]α παρακομισον εγ Μεμφεως  .</p>
            <p xml:id="p1119" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">It is dated L λ Διου ιγ Αθυρ γ and has on the verso the docket of the writer μοσχευματων.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn44" n="44"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/804">P.Cair.Zen. 2 59156</ref>, which includes P.Lond. inv. 2318A.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p1120" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">With regard to the other fragment I remember, but cannot at the moment lay my hand on, a papyrus of ours in which there is mention of honey having been delivered to an Asklepiades. So I should say that the entry on the || verso of your fragment is certainly connected with the recto and should read something like this </p>
            <p xml:id="p1121" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">παρα (or παρ’) and then some proper name (Αρτεμιδωρου?)</p>
            <p xml:id="p1122" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">περι μελιτος, δουναι τωι παρα Ασκληπιαδου.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn45" n="45"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1531">P.Lond. 7 1968</ref>.13–15 παρ’ Ἀρτεμιδώρου | περὶ μέλιτος, δοῦναι τῶι παρὰ | Ἀσκληπιάδου.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p1123" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If we find that we have each a number of fragments which would complete some of the papyri in our respective collections, would Br. Mus. be willing to make an exchange? There would be no difficulty on our side, but you may perhaps be bound to stricter rules. We have already exchanged some fragments with Florence, to the advantage of both collections; and it seems to me a very commendable practice. </p>

            <p xml:id="p1125" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">P.S.

            <p xml:id="p1134" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">	They are for the most part unrevised copies and no doubt contain many errors, especially among the letters next to the breaks.

The measurements are in centimetres and millimetres, height and width; || and by height I mean the height of the recto of the document, quite irrespective of the direction of the fibres. ‘Written along’ a ‘written horizontally’ means that the writing is in line with the fibres; ‘written across’ means that it is at right angles to them.</p>

            <p xml:id="p1163" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Kelsey has just written to say that he is leaving for England about the 14th, that he is bringing over the new lot of Zenon papyri so that I can copy them in the Br. Mus. and that he hopes to meet me there. But as I am leaving on the morning of the 23rd it is scarcely likely that I shall be able to see him in London. Probably, however, he will be willing to leave the papyri in the B.M. until my return next summer, if you have no objection. It is much more satisfactory to copy from the originals than from photographs.</p>
            <p xml:id="p1164" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind verifying one point for me?

            <p xml:id="p1169" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I saw Hunt last week and spoke to him about the bibliography but he was already in communication with you and was trying to find you a collaborator. Let us hope he will succeed.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn64" n="64"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Hunt had written to Bell on 31 July 1927 (BL Add. MS 59512, f. 176): ‘Segrè might be tried for bibliography if no one else at home can be got, but he always strikes me as rather inaccurate and I should prefer an Englishman if one can be found. I can’t say why || J.G. Milne won’t: he has plenty of time, surely. Another possibility occurs to me in C.C. Edgar who has just left Egypt for good. I should imagine that he is likely to settle somewhere within reach of books. He wrote lately that he hopes to be in Oxford shortly and would like to see me, so I could mention it if you like.’ Bell had been responsible for compiling the bibliography for Graeco-Roman Egypt in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> since 1914. The instalment published in 1927 was signed by three contributors (Bell et al. 1927), with a note by Bell explaining the background. His promotion to Deputy Keeper in 1927 increased the difficulty of the task. The next instalment was the work of eight contributors (Milne et al. 1928); J.G. Milne was among them, but not Edgar (or Segrè). Edgar only contributed the section on ‘Publications of non-literary texts’ in the bibliography for 1932–1933 (Milne et al. 1934: 88–92), replacing Bell.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p1170" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">At present I am compiling the Index to my catalogue, a long but unavoidable piece of drudgery, but I hope to come next week to the B.M., Tuesday or Wednesday, and put in a few || hours on the Michigan papyri. It is good news that your Ptolemaic volume is now in prospect.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn65" n="65"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell (1927a: 1) noted that ‘vol. VI of the Catalogue, … will, it is hoped, contain all the Ptolemaic papyri acquired since 1906’. This had been the plan for some time (‘Volume VI of the Museum Catalogue is likely to consist entirely of Ptolemaic texts.’ [Bell 1922: 100]), and this remained the case in the years that followed (‘vol. VI … will consist entirely of Ptolemaic papyri’ [<ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34376">Bell 1933</ref>: 514]). The project was subsequently handed over to T. C. Skeat, and the volume was numbered VII. </p></note></p>

It is true also that the name of Zenon continued to be prominent in Philadelphia after our Zenon’s death, like that of his partner Sostratos (see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95152">Partsch - Wilcken, Jur.

            <p xml:id="p1231" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking up the passages in which ἐνοχλεῖσθαι is used of animals, I came across a curious phrase in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7495">P.Petrie II, no. 25 (a)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον ἐνοχλούμενον ἐγλοηθέν  θατα.

II, no. 25 (b)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον \ἐνοχλούμενον/ ἐγλοηθέντα καὶ φλεβοτομηθέντα, but in the facsimile it seems to me that the word is clearly ἐγλουσθέντα, ‘after having received a drench and been bled.’ If you have time one day, could you verify on the originals (B.M.

            <p xml:id="p1236" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind giving me an impartial opinion on the following point?</p>
            <p xml:id="p1237" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>. The latter course would be simpler and would improve the make-up of the book. The former course would necessitate the transference of the note from the preliminary matter \(in which it is out of scale)/ to a place between the Introduction and the Texts. But is the information which it gives about the form of a typical Ptolemaic letter of sufficient interest to justify a departure from the ordinary arrangement? Or do you think that to any likely reader the information is superfluous? ||</p>
            <p xml:id="p1238" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I am in doubt myself and should in any case attach more weight to your opinion than to my own in a question of this sort.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn98" n="98"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar ultimately opted for the ‘former course’; see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, pp. 58–60 (‘The form of the papyri and the method of publication’).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p1270" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the off print of your reviews. Hasn’t Boak misunderstood the construction of ll. 9-10 of the edict? It would give better grammar to read [ὧν] in l. 9<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn112" n="112"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34390">Boak 1934</ref>: 1–8, reedited as <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/17375">P.Cair.Isid. 1</ref>, where the passage runs ἀπὸ τοῦ προτεθέντος θείου διατάγματος | καὶ τοῦ αὐτῷ συννηννωμένου βρεουίου [οἷς] τὰ ἀντίγραφα τούτου μου τοῦ διατάγματος | δημοσίᾳ προύταξα, ἔνεστιν κτλ.

Edgar’s proposed emendation, [ὧν] instead of [καί], is recorded in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> 21 (1935) 89, and was also suggested by Wilcken, but the new edition preferred Collomp’s [οἷς].</p></note> and προύταξα, ἔνεστιν πᾶσι εὖ νο[εῖ]  ν in l. 10.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn113" n="113"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/17375">P.Cair.Isid. 1</ref>.10 n. records εὖ νο[εῖ]ν as a suggestiom by Lewis.</p></note></p>

Grenfell seems to have transcribed almost everything<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn115" n="115"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Grenfell’s input is mentioned in the preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3137">P.Tebt. III.1</ref>, but not exactly in these terms. It would be fair to say that without Grenfell’s transcriptions there would have been no P.Tebt. III.1–2.</p></note> and a great deal of work has been done by Hunt and Smyly also. A fair amount of commentary has already been written. Besides this material there || is a large packet of papyri which rather embarrasses me. I doubt whether it would be better to bring it all to the B.M. and take out what I need from time to time or to work through it here and deposit it with you in instalments. Probably the latter method would be better as some of the material is very fragile and might be injured by being carried backwards and forwards.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn116" n="116"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3740">P.Tebt.

            <p xml:id="p1275" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I should have written before now to thank you for the information in your last letter and also for the reprint of your excellent bibliography,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn33" n="33"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell 1921.</p></note> but I have been ill and have only now returned to work.</p>

Evelyn-White (1884–1924).</p></note> bought a long Augustan papyrus for Prof. Kelsey and handed it over to me. White has gone home and Kelsey wants me to take the papyrus to England and give it to you to keep for him, or else send it to you. Though I hope to be in England shortly, I do not wish to carry antiquities out of Egypt, so I am going to send it to you after getting the Museum permit and paying the customs dues. You will no doubt recognise it when it arrives. I don’t know why Kelsey did not ask White to send the papyrus straight to its destination.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn35" n="35"><p style="text-align: justify; "> P.Mich. inv. 613. The <ref target="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/a/apis/x-7785/">APIS entry</ref> records that the papyrus ‘was forwarded to London by CC Edgar’. A letter of F. W. Kelsey to H. I. Bell dated 25 June 1921 (in BL Add. MS 89298) relates the following: ‘Under date of June 12th Mr C.C. Edgar wrote to me that he has sent to you for me a papyrus which Dr. Grenfell selected last year but which I had no time to acquire before leaving Cairo. Mr White obtained it for me, and delivered it to Mr Edgar, who kept it at the Museum. This is paid for independently, and if you will be good enough to keep it for me till I go to London it will be an additional favour.’</p></note></p>

The fine Zenon papyri which you mention were offered to us indirectly last spring, but the price asked was far beyond our resources. We may possibly get another collection of fragments, but it is doubtful; like most European Museums we are in very low water.</p>
            <p xml:id="p1281" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If your no. 2312<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn36" n="36"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2384">P.Lond. 7 1941</ref>.</p></note> is between 120 and 125<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn37" n="37"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell pencilled ‘124 mm’; the height is given as 12.5 cm in the edition.</p></note> mill. high, I believe that we have a fragment of the same letter.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn38" n="38"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Transcribed in the next letter.</p></note> I will send you my copy as soon as I have revised it on the original, but the Museum is shut until the 13th. If I am right, the first two lines will read pretty nearly as follows: Ιεροκλης Ζηνωνι χαιρειν. ει ερρω[σαι τε τωι σωματι και εστι σου τα] αλλα [κατα γνωμην], καλως αν εχοι· υγιαινω δε και αυτο[ς. περι του παιδαριου εγραψας μο]ι, ει με[ν επισταμεθα] ακριβως οτι νικησει, αλειφειν, ει δε μη,                 [. In any case your new fragment not only enables us to understand my no. 11 with greater exactness, but also explains a thing which had puzzled me. Besides no. 11<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn39" n="39"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/718">P.Cair.Zen. 1 59060</ref>.</p></note> we have another letter<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn40" n="40"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/719">P.Cair.Zen. 1 59061</ref>.</p></note> from Hierokles, received on the 2nd of Xandikos || and giving the gist of the second half of no. 11. Your no. 2312 now gives the gist of the first half. Something of this sort seems to have happened. Hierokles wrote no. 11 first, found it not quite satisfactory, and wrote the other two letters instead of it. But by some mistake no. 11 was sent to Zenon as well as the other two; perhaps by a different messenger, as it arrived a day later. I infer that no. 11 was the rejected copy from the fact that it is less correctly expressed. See especially the phrase in l. 2: ἔγραψάς μοι εἰ μὲν ἀκρειβῶς ἐπιστάμεθα ἀλείφειν αὐτόν    . As the words stand this means ‘you told us to train him if we know exactly how to do so’. But the new letter shows that Hierokles meant to say ‘if we are perfectly sure that he will win’. Incidentally it makes two other points quite clear, 1) that Pyrrhos was being trained to compete in the games and 2) that Hierokles wrote from Alexandria (see the expression καταγαγηις in l.11).</p>

            <p xml:id="p1305" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Mr. Bell, </p>
            <p xml:id="p1306" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Your notes are always interesting. One of the fragments which you transcribe completes a letter in our collection beginning [Απολλωνιος] Ζηνωνι χαιρειν. μοσχευματα απιων και φυτα οτι [πλειστ]α παρακομισον εγ Μεμφεως  .</p>
            <p xml:id="p1307" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">It is dated L λ Διου ιγ Αθυρ γ and has on the verso the docket of the writer μοσχευματων.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn44" n="44"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/804">P.Cair.Zen. 2 59156</ref>, which includes P.Lond. inv. 2318A.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p1308" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">With regard to the other fragment I remember, but cannot at the moment lay my hand on, a papyrus of ours in which there is mention of honey having been delivered to an Asklepiades. So I should say that the entry on the || verso of your fragment is certainly connected with the recto and should read something like this </p>
            <p xml:id="p1309" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">παρα (or παρ’) and then some proper name (Αρτεμιδωρου?)</p>
            <p xml:id="p1310" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">περι μελιτος, δουναι τωι παρα Ασκληπιαδου.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn45" n="45"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1531">P.Lond. 7 1968</ref>.13–15 παρ’ Ἀρτεμιδώρου | περὶ μέλιτος, δοῦναι τῶι παρὰ | Ἀσκληπιάδου.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p1311" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If we find that we have each a number of fragments which would complete some of the papyri in our respective collections, would Br. Mus. be willing to make an exchange? There would be no difficulty on our side, but you may perhaps be bound to stricter rules. We have already exchanged some fragments with Florence, to the advantage of both collections; and it seems to me a very commendable practice. </p>

            <p xml:id="p1313" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">P.S.

            <p xml:id="p1322" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">	They are for the most part unrevised copies and no doubt contain many errors, especially among the letters next to the breaks.

            <p xml:id="p1357" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I saw Hunt last week and spoke to him about the bibliography but he was already in communication with you and was trying to find you a collaborator. Let us hope he will succeed.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn64" n="64"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Hunt had written to Bell on 31 July 1927 (BL Add. MS 59512, f. 176): ‘Segrè might be tried for bibliography if no one else at home can be got, but he always strikes me as rather inaccurate and I should prefer an Englishman if one can be found. I can’t say why || J.G. Milne won’t: he has plenty of time, surely. Another possibility occurs to me in C.C. Edgar who has just left Egypt for good. I should imagine that he is likely to settle somewhere within reach of books. He wrote lately that he hopes to be in Oxford shortly and would like to see me, so I could mention it if you like.’ Bell had been responsible for compiling the bibliography for Graeco-Roman Egypt in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> since 1914. The instalment published in 1927 was signed by three contributors (Bell et al. 1927), with a note by Bell explaining the background. His promotion to Deputy Keeper in 1927 increased the difficulty of the task. The next instalment was the work of eight contributors (Milne et al. 1928); J.G. Milne was among them, but not Edgar (or Segrè). Edgar only contributed the section on ‘Publications of non-literary texts’ in the bibliography for 1932–1933 (Milne et al. 1934: 88–92), replacing Bell.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p1358" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">At present I am compiling the Index to my catalogue, a long but unavoidable piece of drudgery, but I hope to come next week to the B.M., Tuesday or Wednesday, and put in a few || hours on the Michigan papyri. It is good news that your Ptolemaic volume is now in prospect.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn65" n="65"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell (1927a: 1) noted that ‘vol. VI of the Catalogue, … will, it is hoped, contain all the Ptolemaic papyri acquired since 1906’. This had been the plan for some time (‘Volume VI of the Museum Catalogue is likely to consist entirely of Ptolemaic texts.’ [Bell 1922: 100]), and this remained the case in the years that followed (‘vol. VI … will consist entirely of Ptolemaic papyri’ [<ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34376">Bell 1933</ref>: 514]). The project was subsequently handed over to T. C. Skeat, and the volume was numbered VII. </p></note></p>

Nikios was an important town midway between Naukratis and Memphis. My suggested reading of l. 60 must be wrong, but I suppose it cannot be corrected into ἐπὶ τοῦ Δέλτα.

Meyer’s καλλοινήν (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 90</ref>) seems to me rather questionable, and I do not feel much confidence in his transcriptions. He has made nonsense of no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28701">87</ref> by reading Βαιβ̣ίνης instead of the obvious βαροίνῃς (= βαρύνῃς), ‘do not burden yourself with the wedding outfit, but bring a reasonable amount’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn84" n="84"><p style="text-align: justify; "> βαρύνῃς was doubtfully conjectured by Schubart (BL 2.2.75); βαροίνῃς was read on the original much later (BL 13.105).</p></note> In no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">88</ref> again the word which he reads as ἐγαίσησες and which Wilcken amends into ἐγαὶς Ἦσες (= ὑγιὴς Ἦσις) is no doubt ἐγάμησες, as is shown by the phrase in l. 7 καὶ νῦν ὡς ἄνθρωπος τέλειος || γενάμενος ‘and now also that you are a married man’ (Hesych. τέλειοι οἱ γεγαμηκότες).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn85" n="85"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">P.Hamb. 1 88</ref> was reedited in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 556–562, who read ἐγάμησες on a photograph (BL 5.40). <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 561 accepted Meyer’s legal interpretation of τέλειος.</p></note> So I should not be surprised if he also has gone wrong over καλλοινήν.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn86" n="86"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The passage (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 1 90</ref>.5–7) was read as ὡς ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ π̣ε|ρὶ τοῦ γόμου τοῦ οἴνο̣υ, ἐ̣κλί|σθη καλῶς καὶ τὴν καλλοιν̣[ὴν   ̣  ̣  ̣  ̣] καὶ ἐ̣σφράγισα. The <ref target="http://resolver.sub.uni-hamburg.de/goobi/HANSh817">online image</ref> shows that καλλοι is possible, but there is no word beginning καλλοιν- ; the upright could also belong to nu. After that, there are traces of two letters; καλλον̣ή̣ν̣ is conceivable, but it is difficult to account for the accusative in the sequence.

            <p xml:id="p1388" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">There is a difficult phrase in one of the Zenon texts, <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2080">P.S.I. 396</ref>, τῆς προστάδος των καλαίνων οὗ   κε οἶνος κεῖται μου.

            <p xml:id="p1419" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking up the passages in which ἐνοχλεῖσθαι is used of animals, I came across a curious phrase in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7495">P.Petrie II, no. 25 (a)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον ἐνοχλούμενον ἐγλοηθέν  θατα. In P.Petrie III Smyly quotes Mayser to the effect that ἐγλοηθέντα = ἐγλογηθέντα, ‘ausgeschieden’. The phrase recurs in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7496">P.P. II, no. 25 (b)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον \ἐνοχλούμενον/ ἐγλοηθέντα καὶ φλεβοτομηθέντα, but in the facsimile it seems to me that the word is clearly ἐγλουσθέντα, ‘after having received a drench and been bled.’ If you have time one day, could you verify on the originals (B.M. DLIX–X<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn96" n="96"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The actual inventory numbers are DLVIII–DLIX (558–559).</p></note>) whether my reading is right.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn97" n="97"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell pencilled, ‘probably’. Mayser’s interpretation, quoted in P.Petr. 3 61b, had also been questioned by Wilcken, who suggested that ἐγλοηθέντα stands for ἐκλουθέντα (Wilcken 1906: 519 = BL 1.360).</p></note> Mayser’s explanation strikes me as very far-fetched.</p>

            <p xml:id="p1424" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind giving me an impartial opinion on the following point?</p>
            <p xml:id="p1425" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>. The latter course would be simpler and would improve the make-up of the book. The former course would necessitate the transference of the note from the preliminary matter \(in which it is out of scale)/ to a place between the Introduction and the Texts. But is the information which it gives about the form of a typical Ptolemaic letter of sufficient interest to justify a departure from the ordinary arrangement? Or do you think that to any likely reader the information is superfluous? ||</p>
            <p xml:id="p1426" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I am in doubt myself and should in any case attach more weight to your opinion than to my own in a question of this sort.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn98" n="98"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar ultimately opted for the ‘former course’; see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, pp. 58–60 (‘The form of the papyri and the method of publication’).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p1431" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I observed lately that <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.Cairo</seg> 59415 and <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.S.I.</seg> 376 make up a nearly complete letter from Deinon dated L λϛ Υπερβερε ιζ. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn99" n="99"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The join was noted in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95113">P.Cair.Zen. 4</ref>, p. 289.

Besides this material there || is a large packet of papyri which rather embarrasses me. I doubt whether it would be better to bring it all to the B.M. and take out what I need from time to time or to work through it here and deposit it with you in instalments. Probably the latter method would be better as some of the material is very fragile and might be injured by being carried backwards and forwards.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn116" n="116"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3740">P.Tebt.

            <p xml:id="p1461" style="text-align: left; ">Cairo | 11.11.21</p>
            <p xml:id="p1462" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Mr. Bell, </p>
            <p xml:id="p1463" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for your interesting letter, which I have just received. Yes, I called on you at the British Museum in September, but found you were away on leave. Perhaps I may be more fortunate next summer. The fine Zenon papyri which you mention were offered to us indirectly last spring, but the price asked was far beyond our resources. We may possibly get another collection of fragments, but it is doubtful; like most European Museums we are in very low water.</p>
            <p xml:id="p1464" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If your no. 2312<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn36" n="36"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2384">P.Lond. 7 1941</ref>.</p></note> is between 120 and 125<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn37" n="37"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell pencilled ‘124 mm’; the height is given as 12.5 cm in the edition.</p></note> mill. high, I believe that we have a fragment of the same letter.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn38" n="38"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Transcribed in the next letter.</p></note> I will send you my copy as soon as I have revised it on the original, but the Museum is shut until the 13th. If I am right, the first two lines will read pretty nearly as follows: Ιεροκλης Ζηνωνι χαιρειν. ει ερρω[σαι τε τωι σωματι και εστι σου τα] αλλα [κατα γνωμην], καλως αν εχοι· υγιαινω δε και αυτο[ς. περι του παιδαριου εγραψας μο]ι, ει με[ν επισταμεθα] ακριβως οτι νικησει, αλειφειν, ει δε μη,                 [. In any case your new fragment not only enables us to understand my no. 11 with greater exactness, but also explains a thing which had puzzled me. Besides no. 11<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn39" n="39"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/718">P.Cair.Zen. 1 59060</ref>.</p></note> we have another letter<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn40" n="40"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/719">P.Cair.Zen. 1 59061</ref>.</p></note> from Hierokles, received on the 2nd of Xandikos || and giving the gist of the second half of no. 11. Your no. 2312 now gives the gist of the first half. Something of this sort seems to have happened. Hierokles wrote no. 11 first, found it not quite satisfactory, and wrote the other two letters instead of it. But by some mistake no. 11 was sent to Zenon as well as the other two; perhaps by a different messenger, as it arrived a day later. I infer that no. 11 was the rejected copy from the fact that it is less correctly expressed. See especially the phrase in l. 2: ἔγραψάς μοι εἰ μὲν ἀκρειβῶς ἐπιστάμεθα ἀλείφειν αὐτόν    . As the words stand this means ‘you told us to train him if we know exactly how to do so’. But the new letter shows that Hierokles meant to say ‘if we are perfectly sure that he will win’. Incidentally it makes two other points quite clear, 1) that Pyrrhos was being trained to compete in the games and 2) that Hierokles wrote from Alexandria (see the expression καταγαγηις in l.11).</p>

            <p xml:id="p1488" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Mr. Bell, </p>
            <p xml:id="p1489" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Your notes are always interesting. One of the fragments which you transcribe completes a letter in our collection beginning [Απολλωνιος] Ζηνωνι χαιρειν. μοσχευματα απιων και φυτα οτι [πλειστ]α παρακομισον εγ Μεμφεως  .</p>
            <p xml:id="p1490" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">It is dated L λ Διου ιγ Αθυρ γ and has on the verso the docket of the writer μοσχευματων.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn44" n="44"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/804">P.Cair.Zen. 2 59156</ref>, which includes P.Lond. inv. 2318A.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p1491" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">With regard to the other fragment I remember, but cannot at the moment lay my hand on, a papyrus of ours in which there is mention of honey having been delivered to an Asklepiades. So I should say that the entry on the || verso of your fragment is certainly connected with the recto and should read something like this </p>
            <p xml:id="p1492" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">παρα (or παρ’) and then some proper name (Αρτεμιδωρου?)</p>
            <p xml:id="p1493" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">περι μελιτος, δουναι τωι παρα Ασκληπιαδου.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn45" n="45"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1531">P.Lond. 7 1968</ref>.13–15 παρ’ Ἀρτεμιδώρου | περὶ μέλιτος, δοῦναι τῶι παρὰ | Ἀσκληπιάδου.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p1494" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If we find that we have each a number of fragments which would complete some of the papyri in our respective collections, would Br. Mus. be willing to make an exchange? There would be no difficulty on our side, but you may perhaps be bound to stricter rules. We have already exchanged some fragments with Florence, to the advantage of both collections; and it seems to me a very commendable practice. </p>

            <p xml:id="p1496" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">P.S.

            <p xml:id="p1505" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">	They are for the most part unrevised copies and no doubt contain many errors, especially among the letters next to the breaks.

The measurements are in centimetres and millimetres, height and width; || and by height I mean the height of the recto of the document, quite irrespective of the direction of the fibres. ‘Written along’ a ‘written horizontally’ means that the writing is in line with the fibres; ‘written across’ means that it is at right angles to them.</p>

I can’t say why || J.G. Milne won’t: he has plenty of time, surely. Another possibility occurs to me in C.C. Edgar who has just left Egypt for good. I should imagine that he is likely to settle somewhere within reach of books. He wrote lately that he hopes to be in Oxford shortly and would like to see me, so I could mention it if you like.’ Bell had been responsible for compiling the bibliography for Graeco-Roman Egypt in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> since 1914. The instalment published in 1927 was signed by three contributors (Bell et al. 1927), with a note by Bell explaining the background. His promotion to Deputy Keeper in 1927 increased the difficulty of the task. The next instalment was the work of eight contributors (Milne et al. 1928); J.G. Milne was among them, but not Edgar (or Segrè). Edgar only contributed the section on ‘Publications of non-literary texts’ in the bibliography for 1932–1933 (Milne et al. 1934: 88–92), replacing Bell.</p></note></p>

It is true also that the name of Zenon continued to be prominent in Philadelphia after our Zenon’s death, like that of his partner Sostratos (see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95152">Partsch - Wilcken, Jur.

In l. 14 is it not possible to read ἐν] Ναυ[κρ]άτι ? If that is right, the tablets are probably an account of a voyage between Alexandria and the Fayoum. Again in l.43 could ἐν τῆι Νικίου be read? Nikios was an important town midway between Naukratis and Memphis. My suggested reading of l. 60 must be wrong, but I suppose it cannot be corrected into ἐπὶ τοῦ Δέλτα. My ἐκ in l. 75 is also wrong and ought to be ἐπὶ.

            <p xml:id="p1570" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking through some of the Hamburg papyri I came upon a reference to <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/36938">P. Lond. V., 1764</ref>, 4, τὴν τοῦ οἴνου καλλονὴν καὶ παραμονήν. Would you mind telling me if the context shows καλλονήν to mean some process of clarifying the wine, or if some other meaning is indicated. Meyer’s καλλοινήν (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 90</ref>) seems to me rather questionable, and I do not feel much confidence in his transcriptions. He has made nonsense of no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28701">87</ref> by reading Βαιβ̣ίνης instead of the obvious βαροίνῃς (= βαρύνῃς), ‘do not burden yourself with the wedding outfit, but bring a reasonable amount’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn84" n="84"><p style="text-align: justify; "> βαρύνῃς was doubtfully conjectured by Schubart (BL 2.2.75); βαροίνῃς was read on the original much later (BL 13.105).</p></note> In no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">88</ref> again the word which he reads as ἐγαίσησες and which Wilcken amends into ἐγαὶς Ἦσες (= ὑγιὴς Ἦσις) is no doubt ἐγάμησες, as is shown by the phrase in l. 7 καὶ νῦν ὡς ἄνθρωπος τέλειος || γενάμενος ‘and now also that you are a married man’ (Hesych. τέλειοι οἱ γεγαμηκότες).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn85" n="85"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">P.Hamb. 1 88</ref> was reedited in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 556–562, who read ἐγάμησες on a photograph (BL 5.40). <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 561 accepted Meyer’s legal interpretation of τέλειος.</p></note> So I should not be surprised if he also has gone wrong over καλλοινήν.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn86" n="86"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The passage (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 1 90</ref>.5–7) was read as ὡς ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ π̣ε|ρὶ τοῦ γόμου τοῦ οἴνο̣υ, ἐ̣κλί|σθη καλῶς καὶ τὴν καλλοιν̣[ὴν   ̣  ̣  ̣  ̣] καὶ ἐ̣σφράγισα. The <ref target="http://resolver.sub.uni-hamburg.de/goobi/HANSh817">online image</ref> shows that καλλοι is possible, but there is no word beginning καλλοιν- ; the upright could also belong to nu. After that, there are traces of two letters; καλλον̣ή̣ν̣ is conceivable, but it is difficult to account for the accusative in the sequence. (In l. 5, read ἐνετείλ⟦λ⟧ω μοι  instead of ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ; cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/110132">P.Sijp 9_d</ref>.8.)</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p1571" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">There is a difficult phrase in one of the Zenon texts, <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2080">P.S.I. 396</ref>, τῆς προστάδος των καλαίνων οὗ   κε οἶνος κεῖται μου. Surely καλαίνων can mean nothing but the cellars (can it be misread for καμαρίων ?),<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn87" n="87"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Later corrected to καμίνων (BL 3.223).</p></note> and it strikes me as possible that what the writer of Hamb. 90 sealed up was not the wine-jars but the deck-house in which they were loaded.

            <p xml:id="p1602" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking up the passages in which ἐνοχλεῖσθαι is used of animals, I came across a curious phrase in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7495">P.Petrie II, no. 25 (a)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον ἐνοχλούμενον ἐγλοηθέν  θατα. In P.Petrie III Smyly quotes Mayser to the effect that ἐγλοηθέντα = ἐγλογηθέντα, ‘ausgeschieden’. The phrase recurs in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7496">P.P. II, no. 25 (b)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον \ἐνοχλούμενον/ ἐγλοηθέντα καὶ φλεβοτομηθέντα, but in the facsimile it seems to me that the word is clearly ἐγλουσθέντα, ‘after having received a drench and been bled.’ If you have time one day, could you verify on the originals (B.M. DLIX–X<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn96" n="96"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The actual inventory numbers are DLVIII–DLIX (558–559).</p></note>) whether my reading is right.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn97" n="97"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell pencilled, ‘probably’. Mayser’s interpretation, quoted in P.Petr. 3 61b, had also been questioned by Wilcken, who suggested that ἐγλοηθέντα stands for ἐκλουθέντα (Wilcken 1906: 519 = BL 1.360).</p></note> Mayser’s explanation strikes me as very far-fetched.</p>
            <p xml:id="p1603" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I hope you found the three off-prints on your table. Many thanks for the loan. </p>

            <p xml:id="p1606" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Bell,</p>
            <p xml:id="p1607" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind giving me an impartial opinion on the following point?</p>
            <p xml:id="p1608" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>. The latter course would be simpler and would improve the make-up of the book. The former course would necessitate the transference of the note from the preliminary matter \(in which it is out of scale)/ to a place between the Introduction and the Texts. But is the information which it gives about the form of a typical Ptolemaic letter of sufficient interest to justify a departure from the ordinary arrangement? Or do you think that to any likely reader the information is superfluous? ||</p>
            <p xml:id="p1609" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I am in doubt myself and should in any case attach more weight to your opinion than to my own in a question of this sort.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn98" n="98"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar ultimately opted for the ‘former course’; see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, pp. 58–60 (‘The form of the papyri and the method of publication’).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p1613" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the trouble you have taken about my proofs. It is satisfactory in a negative way to know that none of your fragments can be fitted on.</p>
            <p xml:id="p1614" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I observed lately that <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.Cairo</seg> 59415 and <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.S.I.</seg> 376 make up a nearly complete letter from Deinon dated L λϛ Υπερβερε ιζ. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn99" n="99"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The join was noted in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95113">P.Cair.Zen. 4</ref>, p. 289. The two fragments were published together in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1477">P.Cair.Zen. 5 59853</ref>.</p></note> That suggested to me that the Manchester fragment might be part of B. M. 2678, and your transcript rather confirms my suspicion.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn100" n="100"><p style="text-align: justify; "> First published in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34820">Edgar 1934</ref>: 124–125 (no. 12), and then as <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2421">P.Ryl. 4 565</ref>.</p></note> Both fragments have the same number of lines, and in several cases they fit together admirably. L. 8 does not trouble me for it might be restored somewhat like this ὅτι γὰρ π[οιήσομεν δεῖ σε] νοεῖν. The only difficulty is in l. 4, where εἰ δὴ μέν   ought to be εἰδῶμεν and Grenfell’s ]εαιει is not quite intelligible. But his copies were made very rapidly and need to be || revised.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn101" n="101"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34820">Edgar 1934</ref>: 111.</p></note> ἀναλαμβάνων in l. 5 must mean ‘recover’ and the next line ‘and see that you grow strong again’; apparently Zenon had had an illness.</p>
            <p xml:id="p1615" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I should much like to see the re-discovered Petrie papyri and hope to have an opportunity some day soon.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn102" n="102"><p style="text-align: justify; "> It is unclear what these papyri were. One possibility is Petrie’s Ptolemaic cartonnage now kept at University College London; cf. P.Pintaudi 17 (esp. p. 78 and n. 10).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p1619" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Thanks for the hand copy, which accords with Grenfell’s note ‘fine large hand’. I feel little doubt about the identification. ειδημεν is not a mistake for ειδωμεν or ειδησωμεν, but the pluperfect (for the form see P.S.I 445,15).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn103" n="103"><p style="text-align: justify; "> PSI 4 445 was republished in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1274">P.Cair.Zen. 4 59643</ref>.

            <p xml:id="p1624" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Hunt has promised to do a volume (or two) of selections from the papyri for the Loeb series, but as he finds it a burden on his other work I have undertaken to do the transcriptions, translations etc, leaving the general selection to him. I feel ill qualified for the task and not very keen about it, but it is evidently desirable that he should be free to get on with his proper work; there || is no one living so good all round as he is. The little that I have done as yet makes me feel that there is a good deal to be done in the verification of readings even in well-known texts, and I should like some time to revise some of those in the B.M.</p>

            <p xml:id="p1665" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Mr. Bell, </p>
            <p xml:id="p1666" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Your notes are always interesting. One of the fragments which you transcribe completes a letter in our collection beginning [Απολλωνιος] Ζηνωνι χαιρειν. μοσχευματα απιων και φυτα οτι [πλειστ]α παρακομισον εγ Μεμφεως  .</p>
            <p xml:id="p1667" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">It is dated L λ Διου ιγ Αθυρ γ and has on the verso the docket of the writer μοσχευματων.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn44" n="44"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/804">P.Cair.Zen. 2 59156</ref>, which includes P.Lond. inv. 2318A.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p1668" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">With regard to the other fragment I remember, but cannot at the moment lay my hand on, a papyrus of ours in which there is mention of honey having been delivered to an Asklepiades. So I should say that the entry on the || verso of your fragment is certainly connected with the recto and should read something like this </p>
            <p xml:id="p1669" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">παρα (or παρ’) and then some proper name (Αρτεμιδωρου?)</p>
            <p xml:id="p1670" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">περι μελιτος, δουναι τωι παρα Ασκληπιαδου.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn45" n="45"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1531">P.Lond. 7 1968</ref>.13–15 παρ’ Ἀρτεμιδώρου | περὶ μέλιτος, δοῦναι τῶι παρὰ | Ἀσκληπιάδου.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p1671" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If we find that we have each a number of fragments which would complete some of the papyri in our respective collections, would Br. Mus. be willing to make an exchange? There would be no difficulty on our side, but you may perhaps be bound to stricter rules. We have already exchanged some fragments with Florence, to the advantage of both collections; and it seems to me a very commendable practice. </p>
            <p xml:id="p1672" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Yours sincerely | C. C. Edgar</p>
            <p xml:id="p1673" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">P.S. I find that Asklepiades is not the name in the papyrus which I spoke of; nevertheless μελιτος seems to be the probable reading.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn46" n="46"><p style="text-align: justify; "> See <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/792">P.Cair.Zen. 3 59311</ref>.9 Ἀρτ̣ε̣[μίδωρος μ]έ̣λιτ̣ο̣ς̣ .</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p1676" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for letting me know about the testimonial to Wilcken.

MS 59518, f. 58), F. Hiller von Gaertringen (Berlin) and W. Otto (Munich) organized a fundraising initiative to support Wilcken’s research on the occasion of his 60th birthday (18 Dec. 1922). Bell communicated this plan to others; in addition to Edgar’s letter, this <seg style="font-style: italic;">Wilckenspende</seg> is mentioned in letters to Bell from Hunt (BL Add.

            <p xml:id="p1677" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">We bought some more Zenon papyri the other day, chiefly fragments. So far as I have examined them, they are not up to the standard of our previous purchases and seizures, though they contain many interesting things. But I shall have no time to study them till next winter. Did Kelsey buy the fine pieces you told me of?</p>

            <p xml:id="p1681" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">	I have prepared a packet of my copies of more than two hundred Zenon fragments, some of which ought surely to complete or be completed by the fragments in the B.M. Instead of sending them through the post I will bring them myself on Tuesday or some other day this week. In case I do not see you I should like to call your attention to the following points:</p>
            <p xml:id="p1682" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">	They are for the most part unrevised copies and no doubt contain many errors, especially among the letters next to the breaks. As they are my only copies I should like to have them back before I return to Cairo, say about the 20th of July. The measurements are in centimetres and millimetres, height and width; || and by height I mean the height of the recto of the document, quite irrespective of the direction of the fibres. ‘Written along’ a ‘written horizontally’ means that the writing is in line with the fibres; ‘written across’ means that it is at right angles to them.</p>
            <p xml:id="p1683" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">	Sincerely hoping that I am not inviting you to undertake a pointless labour, </p>
            <p xml:id="p1684" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">	I am | Yours very truly | C. C. Edgar</p>

            <p xml:id="p1711" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Kelsey has just written to say that he is leaving for England about the 14th, that he is bringing over the new lot of Zenon papyri so that I can copy them in the Br. Mus. and that he hopes to meet me there. But as I am leaving on the morning of the 23rd it is scarcely likely that I shall be able to see him in London. Probably, however, he will be willing to leave the papyri in the B.M. until my return next summer, if you have no objection. It is much more satisfactory to copy from the originals than from photographs.</p>
            <p xml:id="p1712" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind verifying one point for me?

            <p xml:id="p1717" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I saw Hunt last week and spoke to him about the bibliography but he was already in communication with you and was trying to find you a collaborator. Let us hope he will succeed.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn64" n="64"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Hunt had written to Bell on 31 July 1927 (BL Add. MS 59512, f. 176): ‘Segrè might be tried for bibliography if no one else at home can be got, but he always strikes me as rather inaccurate and I should prefer an Englishman if one can be found. I can’t say why || J.G. Milne won’t: he has plenty of time, surely. Another possibility occurs to me in C.C. Edgar who has just left Egypt for good. I should imagine that he is likely to settle somewhere within reach of books. He wrote lately that he hopes to be in Oxford shortly and would like to see me, so I could mention it if you like.’ Bell had been responsible for compiling the bibliography for Graeco-Roman Egypt in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> since 1914. The instalment published in 1927 was signed by three contributors (Bell et al. 1927), with a note by Bell explaining the background. His promotion to Deputy Keeper in 1927 increased the difficulty of the task. The next instalment was the work of eight contributors (Milne et al. 1928); J.G. Milne was among them, but not Edgar (or Segrè). Edgar only contributed the section on ‘Publications of non-literary texts’ in the bibliography for 1932–1933 (Milne et al. 1934: 88–92), replacing Bell.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p1718" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">At present I am compiling the Index to my catalogue, a long but unavoidable piece of drudgery, but I hope to come next week to the B.M., Tuesday or Wednesday, and put in a few || hours on the Michigan papyri. It is good news that your Ptolemaic volume is now in prospect.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn65" n="65"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell (1927a: 1) noted that ‘vol. VI of the Catalogue, … will, it is hoped, contain all the Ptolemaic papyri acquired since 1906’. This had been the plan for some time (‘Volume VI of the Museum Catalogue is likely to consist entirely of Ptolemaic texts.’ [Bell 1922: 100]), and this remained the case in the years that followed (‘vol. VI … will consist entirely of Ptolemaic papyri’ [<ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34376">Bell 1933</ref>: 514]). The project was subsequently handed over to T. C.

It is true also that the name of Zenon continued to be prominent in Philadelphia after our Zenon’s death, like that of his partner Sostratos (see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95152">Partsch - Wilcken, Jur.

            <p xml:id="p1753" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If the Petrie papyrus DXX (= <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7650">P.Petr.

The word in l. 4 which I read with some hesitation as στομ̣ωτ̣ήν would probably give a clue to the meaning if correctly deciphered. If στομωτήν is right, the object of χορηγεῖν would naturally be σκαφεῖα. Enclosed is a very provisional attempt at a restoration.</p>

            <p xml:id="p1779" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking up the passages in which ἐνοχλεῖσθαι is used of animals, I came across a curious phrase in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7495">P.Petrie II, no. 25 (a)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον ἐνοχλούμενον ἐγλοηθέν  θατα.

II, no. 25 (b)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον \ἐνοχλούμενον/ ἐγλοηθέντα καὶ φλεβοτομηθέντα, but in the facsimile it seems to me that the word is clearly ἐγλουσθέντα, ‘after having received a drench and been bled.’ If you have time one day, could you verify on the originals (B.M.

            <p xml:id="p1784" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind giving me an impartial opinion on the following point?</p>
            <p xml:id="p1785" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>. The latter course would be simpler and would improve the make-up of the book. The former course would necessitate the transference of the note from the preliminary matter \(in which it is out of scale)/ to a place between the Introduction and the Texts. But is the information which it gives about the form of a typical Ptolemaic letter of sufficient interest to justify a departure from the ordinary arrangement? Or do you think that to any likely reader the information is superfluous? ||</p>
            <p xml:id="p1786" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I am in doubt myself and should in any case attach more weight to your opinion than to my own in a question of this sort.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn98" n="98"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar ultimately opted for the ‘former course’; see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, pp. 58–60 (‘The form of the papyri and the method of publication’).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p1814" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind verifying a reading in the letter which you published in Archiv VI, p.102?<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn110" n="110"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell 1913: 102.

Is it quite clear or would it be possible to read τὸ δ’?

III.1–2.</p></note> and a great deal of work has been done by Hunt and Smyly also. A fair amount of commentary has already been written. Besides this material there || is a large packet of papyri which rather embarrasses me. I doubt whether it would be better to bring it all to the B.M. and take out what I need from time to time or to work through it here and deposit it with you in instalments. Probably the latter method would be better as some of the material is very fragile and might be injured by being carried backwards and forwards.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn116" n="116"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3740">P.Tebt.

            <p xml:id="p1822" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The Museum | Cairo | 3.12.21</p>
            <p xml:id="p1823" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Mr. Bell, </p>
            <p xml:id="p1824" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Your notes are always interesting. One of the fragments which you transcribe completes a letter in our collection beginning [Απολλωνιος] Ζηνωνι χαιρειν. μοσχευματα απιων και φυτα οτι [πλειστ]α παρακομισον εγ Μεμφεως  .</p>
            <p xml:id="p1825" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">It is dated L λ Διου ιγ Αθυρ γ and has on the verso the docket of the writer μοσχευματων.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn44" n="44"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/804">P.Cair.Zen. 2 59156</ref>, which includes P.Lond. inv. 2318A.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p1826" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">With regard to the other fragment I remember, but cannot at the moment lay my hand on, a papyrus of ours in which there is mention of honey having been delivered to an Asklepiades. So I should say that the entry on the || verso of your fragment is certainly connected with the recto and should read something like this </p>
            <p xml:id="p1827" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">παρα (or παρ’) and then some proper name (Αρτεμιδωρου?)</p>
            <p xml:id="p1828" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">περι μελιτος, δουναι τωι παρα Ασκληπιαδου.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn45" n="45"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1531">P.Lond. 7 1968</ref>.13–15 παρ’ Ἀρτεμιδώρου | περὶ μέλιτος, δοῦναι τῶι παρὰ | Ἀσκληπιάδου.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p1829" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If we find that we have each a number of fragments which would complete some of the papyri in our respective collections, would Br. Mus. be willing to make an exchange? There would be no difficulty on our side, but you may perhaps be bound to stricter rules.

            <p xml:id="p1840" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">	They are for the most part unrevised copies and no doubt contain many errors, especially among the letters next to the breaks.

I can’t say why || J.G. Milne won’t: he has plenty of time, surely. Another possibility occurs to me in C.C. Edgar who has just left Egypt for good. I should imagine that he is likely to settle somewhere within reach of books. He wrote lately that he hopes to be in Oxford shortly and would like to see me, so I could mention it if you like.’ Bell had been responsible for compiling the bibliography for Graeco-Roman Egypt in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> since 1914. The instalment published in 1927 was signed by three contributors (Bell et al. 1927), with a note by Bell explaining the background. His promotion to Deputy Keeper in 1927 increased the difficulty of the task. The next instalment was the work of eight contributors (Milne et al. 1928); J.G. Milne was among them, but not Edgar (or Segrè). Edgar only contributed the section on ‘Publications of non-literary texts’ in the bibliography for 1932–1933 (Milne et al. 1934: 88–92), replacing Bell.</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p1905" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking through some of the Hamburg papyri I came upon a reference to <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/36938">P. Lond. V., 1764</ref>, 4, τὴν τοῦ οἴνου καλλονὴν καὶ παραμονήν. Would you mind telling me if the context shows καλλονήν to mean some process of clarifying the wine, or if some other meaning is indicated. Meyer’s καλλοινήν (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 90</ref>) seems to me rather questionable, and I do not feel much confidence in his transcriptions. He has made nonsense of no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28701">87</ref> by reading Βαιβ̣ίνης instead of the obvious βαροίνῃς (= βαρύνῃς), ‘do not burden yourself with the wedding outfit, but bring a reasonable amount’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn84" n="84"><p style="text-align: justify; "> βαρύνῃς was doubtfully conjectured by Schubart (BL 2.2.75); βαροίνῃς was read on the original much later (BL 13.105).</p></note> In no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">88</ref> again the word which he reads as ἐγαίσησες and which Wilcken amends into ἐγαὶς Ἦσες (= ὑγιὴς Ἦσις) is no doubt ἐγάμησες, as is shown by the phrase in l. 7 καὶ νῦν ὡς ἄνθρωπος τέλειος || γενάμενος ‘and now also that you are a married man’ (Hesych. τέλειοι οἱ γεγαμηκότες).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn85" n="85"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">P.Hamb. 1 88</ref> was reedited in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 556–562, who read ἐγάμησες on a photograph (BL 5.40). <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 561 accepted Meyer’s legal interpretation of τέλειος.</p></note> So I should not be surprised if he also has gone wrong over καλλοινήν.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn86" n="86"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The passage (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 1 90</ref>.5–7) was read as ὡς ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ π̣ε|ρὶ τοῦ γόμου τοῦ οἴνο̣υ, ἐ̣κλί|σθη καλῶς καὶ τὴν καλλοιν̣[ὴν   ̣  ̣  ̣  ̣] καὶ ἐ̣σφράγισα. The <ref target="http://resolver.sub.uni-hamburg.de/goobi/HANSh817">online image</ref> shows that καλλοι is possible, but there is no word beginning καλλοιν- ; the upright could also belong to nu. After that, there are traces of two letters; καλλον̣ή̣ν̣ is conceivable, but it is difficult to account for the accusative in the sequence. (In l. 5, read ἐνετείλ⟦λ⟧ω μοι  instead of ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ; cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/110132">P.Sijp 9_d</ref>.8.)</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p1906" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">There is a difficult phrase in one of the Zenon texts, <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2080">P.S.I. 396</ref>, τῆς προστάδος των καλαίνων οὗ   κε οἶνος κεῖται μου.

            <p xml:id="p1943" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>.

            <p xml:id="p1948" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the trouble you have taken about my proofs. It is satisfactory in a negative way to know that none of your fragments can be fitted on.</p>
            <p xml:id="p1949" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I observed lately that <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.Cairo</seg> 59415 and <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.S.I.</seg> 376 make up a nearly complete letter from Deinon dated L λϛ Υπερβερε ιζ. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn99" n="99"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The join was noted in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95113">P.Cair.Zen. 4</ref>, p. 289. The two fragments were published together in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1477">P.Cair.Zen. 5 59853</ref>.</p></note> That suggested to me that the Manchester fragment might be part of B. M. 2678, and your transcript rather confirms my suspicion.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn100" n="100"><p style="text-align: justify; "> First published in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34820">Edgar 1934</ref>: 124–125 (no. 12), and then as <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2421">P.Ryl. 4 565</ref>.</p></note> Both fragments have the same number of lines, and in several cases they fit together admirably. L. 8 does not trouble me for it might be restored somewhat like this ὅτι γὰρ π[οιήσομεν δεῖ σε] νοεῖν. The only difficulty is in l. 4, where εἰ δὴ μέν   ought to be εἰδῶμεν and Grenfell’s ]εαιει is not quite intelligible. But his copies were made very rapidly and need to be || revised.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn101" n="101"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34820">Edgar 1934</ref>: 111.</p></note> ἀναλαμβάνων in l. 5 must mean ‘recover’ and the next line ‘and see that you grow strong again’; apparently Zenon had had an illness.</p>
            <p xml:id="p1950" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I should much like to see the re-discovered Petrie papyri and hope to have an opportunity some day soon.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn102" n="102"><p style="text-align: justify; "> It is unclear what these papyri were. One possibility is Petrie’s Ptolemaic cartonnage now kept at University College London; cf. P.Pintaudi 17 (esp. p. 78 and n. 10).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p1954" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Thanks for the hand copy, which accords with Grenfell’s note ‘fine large hand’. I feel little doubt about the identification. ειδημεν is not a mistake for ειδωμεν or ειδησωμεν, but the pluperfect (for the form see P.S.I 445,15).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn103" n="103"><p style="text-align: justify; "> PSI 4 445 was republished in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1274">P.Cair.Zen. 4 59643</ref>.

Cairo Zen. 59643, 15) and is not to be corrected to εἰδή&lt;σω&gt;μεν or εἰδ&lt;εί&gt;ημεν. The construction is a rarity in texts of this kind, but Deinon writes a rather superior style.’</p></note> Used quite correctly after εδει ... γραψαι.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn104" n="104"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Cf. Kühner–Gerth, <seg style="font-style: italic;">Grammatik</seg> ii 553 §7 (we owe the reference to D.

            <p xml:id="p1959" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Hunt has promised to do a volume (or two) of selections from the papyri for the Loeb series, but as he finds it a burden on his other work I have undertaken to do the transcriptions, translations etc, leaving the general selection to him. I feel ill qualified for the task and not very keen about it, but it is evidently desirable that he should be free to get on with his proper work; there || is no one living so good all round as he is. The little that I have done as yet makes me feel that there is a good deal to be done in the verification of readings even in well-known texts, and I should like some time to revise some of those in the B.M.</p>

            <p xml:id="p1976" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the off print of your reviews. Hasn’t Boak misunderstood the construction of ll. 9-10 of the edict?

Besides this material there || is a large packet of papyri which rather embarrasses me. I doubt whether it would be better to bring it all to the B.M. and take out what I need from time to time or to work through it here and deposit it with you in instalments.

            <p xml:id="p1986" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">	I have prepared a packet of my copies of more than two hundred Zenon fragments, some of which ought surely to complete or be completed by the fragments in the B.M. Instead of sending them through the post I will bring them myself on Tuesday or some other day this week. In case I do not see you I should like to call your attention to the following points:</p>
            <p xml:id="p1987" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">	They are for the most part unrevised copies and no doubt contain many errors, especially among the letters next to the breaks. As they are my only copies I should like to have them back before I return to Cairo, say about the 20th of July. The measurements are in centimetres and millimetres, height and width; || and by height I mean the height of the recto of the document, quite irrespective of the direction of the fibres. ‘Written along’ a ‘written horizontally’ means that the writing is in line with the fibres; ‘written across’ means that it is at right angles to them.</p>

            <p xml:id="p2016" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Kelsey has just written to say that he is leaving for England about the 14th, that he is bringing over the new lot of Zenon papyri so that I can copy them in the Br.

            <p xml:id="p2022" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I saw Hunt last week and spoke to him about the bibliography but he was already in communication with you and was trying to find you a collaborator. Let us hope he will succeed.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn64" n="64"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Hunt had written to Bell on 31 July 1927 (BL Add. MS 59512, f. 176): ‘Segrè might be tried for bibliography if no one else at home can be got, but he always strikes me as rather inaccurate and I should prefer an Englishman if one can be found. I can’t say why || J.G. Milne won’t: he has plenty of time, surely. Another possibility occurs to me in C.C. Edgar who has just left Egypt for good. I should imagine that he is likely to settle somewhere within reach of books. He wrote lately that he hopes to be in Oxford shortly and would like to see me, so I could mention it if you like.’ Bell had been responsible for compiling the bibliography for Graeco-Roman Egypt in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> since 1914. The instalment published in 1927 was signed by three contributors (Bell et al. 1927), with a note by Bell explaining the background. His promotion to Deputy Keeper in 1927 increased the difficulty of the task. The next instalment was the work of eight contributors (Milne et al. 1928); J.G. Milne was among them, but not Edgar (or Segrè). Edgar only contributed the section on ‘Publications of non-literary texts’ in the bibliography for 1932–1933 (Milne et al. 1934: 88–92), replacing Bell.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p2023" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">At present I am compiling the Index to my catalogue, a long but unavoidable piece of drudgery, but I hope to come next week to the B.M., Tuesday or Wednesday, and put in a few || hours on the Michigan papyri. It is good news that your Ptolemaic volume is now in prospect.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn65" n="65"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell (1927a: 1) noted that ‘vol. VI of the Catalogue, … will, it is hoped, contain all the Ptolemaic papyri acquired since 1906’. This had been the plan for some time (‘Volume VI of the Museum Catalogue is likely to consist entirely of Ptolemaic texts.’ [Bell 1922: 100]), and this remained the case in the years that followed (‘vol. VI … will consist entirely of Ptolemaic papyri’ [<ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34376">Bell 1933</ref>: 514]). The project was subsequently handed over to T. C.

It is true also that the name of Zenon continued to be prominent in Philadelphia after our Zenon’s death, like that of his partner Sostratos (see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95152">Partsch - Wilcken, Jur.

Nikios was an important town midway between Naukratis and Memphis. My suggested reading of l. 60 must be wrong, but I suppose it cannot be corrected into ἐπὶ τοῦ Δέλτα.

            <p xml:id="p2052" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking through some of the Hamburg papyri I came upon a reference to <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/36938">P. Lond. V., 1764</ref>, 4, τὴν τοῦ οἴνου καλλονὴν καὶ παραμονήν. Would you mind telling me if the context shows καλλονήν to mean some process of clarifying the wine, or if some other meaning is indicated. Meyer’s καλλοινήν (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 90</ref>) seems to me rather questionable, and I do not feel much confidence in his transcriptions. He has made nonsense of no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28701">87</ref> by reading Βαιβ̣ίνης instead of the obvious βαροίνῃς (= βαρύνῃς), ‘do not burden yourself with the wedding outfit, but bring a reasonable amount’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn84" n="84"><p style="text-align: justify; "> βαρύνῃς was doubtfully conjectured by Schubart (BL 2.2.75); βαροίνῃς was read on the original much later (BL 13.105).</p></note> In no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">88</ref> again the word which he reads as ἐγαίσησες and which Wilcken amends into ἐγαὶς Ἦσες (= ὑγιὴς Ἦσις) is no doubt ἐγάμησες, as is shown by the phrase in l. 7 καὶ νῦν ὡς ἄνθρωπος τέλειος || γενάμενος ‘and now also that you are a married man’ (Hesych. τέλειοι οἱ γεγαμηκότες).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn85" n="85"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">P.Hamb. 1 88</ref> was reedited in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 556–562, who read ἐγάμησες on a photograph (BL 5.40). <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 561 accepted Meyer’s legal interpretation of τέλειος.</p></note> So I should not be surprised if he also has gone wrong over καλλοινήν.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn86" n="86"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The passage (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 1 90</ref>.5–7) was read as ὡς ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ π̣ε|ρὶ τοῦ γόμου τοῦ οἴνο̣υ, ἐ̣κλί|σθη καλῶς καὶ τὴν καλλοιν̣[ὴν   ̣  ̣  ̣  ̣] καὶ ἐ̣σφράγισα. The <ref target="http://resolver.sub.uni-hamburg.de/goobi/HANSh817">online image</ref> shows that καλλοι is possible, but there is no word beginning καλλοιν- ; the upright could also belong to nu. After that, there are traces of two letters; καλλον̣ή̣ν̣ is conceivable, but it is difficult to account for the accusative in the sequence. (In l. 5, read ἐνετείλ⟦λ⟧ω μοι  instead of ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ; cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/110132">P.Sijp 9_d</ref>.8.)</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p2053" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">There is a difficult phrase in one of the Zenon texts, <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2080">P.S.I. 396</ref>, τῆς προστάδος των καλαίνων οὗ   κε οἶνος κεῖται μου. Surely καλαίνων can mean nothing but the cellars (can it be misread for καμαρίων ?),<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn87" n="87"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Later corrected to καμίνων (BL 3.223).</p></note> and it strikes me as possible that what the writer of Hamb. 90 sealed up was not the wine-jars but the deck-house in which they were loaded.

            <p xml:id="p2084" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking up the passages in which ἐνοχλεῖσθαι is used of animals, I came across a curious phrase in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7495">P.Petrie II, no. 25 (a)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον ἐνοχλούμενον ἐγλοηθέν  θατα. In P.Petrie III Smyly quotes Mayser to the effect that ἐγλοηθέντα = ἐγλογηθέντα, ‘ausgeschieden’. The phrase recurs in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7496">P.P. II, no. 25 (b)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον \ἐνοχλούμενον/ ἐγλοηθέντα καὶ φλεβοτομηθέντα, but in the facsimile it seems to me that the word is clearly ἐγλουσθέντα, ‘after having received a drench and been bled.’ If you have time one day, could you verify on the originals (B.M. DLIX–X<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn96" n="96"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The actual inventory numbers are DLVIII–DLIX (558–559).</p></note>) whether my reading is right.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn97" n="97"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell pencilled, ‘probably’. Mayser’s interpretation, quoted in P.Petr. 3 61b, had also been questioned by Wilcken, who suggested that ἐγλοηθέντα stands for ἐκλουθέντα (Wilcken 1906: 519 = BL 1.360).</p></note> Mayser’s explanation strikes me as very far-fetched.</p>
            <p xml:id="p2085" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I hope you found the three off-prints on your table. Many thanks for the loan. </p>

            <p xml:id="p2089" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind giving me an impartial opinion on the following point?</p>
            <p xml:id="p2090" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>. The latter course would be simpler and would improve the make-up of the book. The former course would necessitate the transference of the note from the preliminary matter \(in which it is out of scale)/ to a place between the Introduction and the Texts. But is the information which it gives about the form of a typical Ptolemaic letter of sufficient interest to justify a departure from the ordinary arrangement? Or do you think that to any likely reader the information is superfluous? ||</p>
            <p xml:id="p2091" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I am in doubt myself and should in any case attach more weight to your opinion than to my own in a question of this sort.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn98" n="98"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar ultimately opted for the ‘former course’; see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, pp. 58–60 (‘The form of the papyri and the method of publication’).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p2095" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the trouble you have taken about my proofs. It is satisfactory in a negative way to know that none of your fragments can be fitted on.</p>
            <p xml:id="p2096" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I observed lately that <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.Cairo</seg> 59415 and <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.S.I.</seg> 376 make up a nearly complete letter from Deinon dated L λϛ Υπερβερε ιζ. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn99" n="99"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The join was noted in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95113">P.Cair.Zen. 4</ref>, p. 289. The two fragments were published together in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1477">P.Cair.Zen. 5 59853</ref>.</p></note> That suggested to me that the Manchester fragment might be part of B. M. 2678, and your transcript rather confirms my suspicion.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn100" n="100"><p style="text-align: justify; "> First published in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34820">Edgar 1934</ref>: 124–125 (no. 12), and then as <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2421">P.Ryl. 4 565</ref>.</p></note> Both fragments have the same number of lines, and in several cases they fit together admirably. L. 8 does not trouble me for it might be restored somewhat like this ὅτι γὰρ π[οιήσομεν δεῖ σε] νοεῖν. The only difficulty is in l. 4, where εἰ δὴ μέν   ought to be εἰδῶμεν and Grenfell’s ]εαιει is not quite intelligible.

            <p xml:id="p2097" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I should much like to see the re-discovered Petrie papyri and hope to have an opportunity some day soon.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn102" n="102"><p style="text-align: justify; "> It is unclear what these papyri were.

            <p xml:id="p2101" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Thanks for the hand copy, which accords with Grenfell’s note ‘fine large hand’. I feel little doubt about the identification. ειδημεν is not a mistake for ειδωμεν or ειδησωμεν, but the pluperfect (for the form see P.S.I 445,15).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn103" n="103"><p style="text-align: justify; "> PSI 4 445 was republished in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1274">P.Cair.Zen. 4 59643</ref>.

            <p xml:id="p2106" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Hunt has promised to do a volume (or two) of selections from the papyri for the Loeb series, but as he finds it a burden on his other work I have undertaken to do the transcriptions, translations etc, leaving the general selection to him. I feel ill qualified for the task and not very keen about it, but it is evidently desirable that he should be free to get on with his proper work; there || is no one living so good all round as he is. The little that I have done as yet makes me feel that there is a good deal to be done in the verification of readings even in well-known texts, and I should like some time to revise some of those in the B.M.</p>

            <p xml:id="p2127" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Bell, </p>
            <p xml:id="p2128" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">	I have prepared a packet of my copies of more than two hundred Zenon fragments, some of which ought surely to complete or be completed by the fragments in the B.M. Instead of sending them through the post I will bring them myself on Tuesday or some other day this week. In case I do not see you I should like to call your attention to the following points:</p>
            <p xml:id="p2129" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">	They are for the most part unrevised copies and no doubt contain many errors, especially among the letters next to the breaks. As they are my only copies I should like to have them back before I return to Cairo, say about the 20th of July. The measurements are in centimetres and millimetres, height and width; || and by height I mean the height of the recto of the document, quite irrespective of the direction of the fibres. ‘Written along’ a ‘written horizontally’ means that the writing is in line with the fibres; ‘written across’ means that it is at right angles to them.</p>
            <p xml:id="p2130" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">	Sincerely hoping that I am not inviting you to undertake a pointless labour, </p>
            <p xml:id="p2131" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">	I am | Yours very truly | C. C. Edgar</p>

            <p xml:id="p2158" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Kelsey has just written to say that he is leaving for England about the 14th, that he is bringing over the new lot of Zenon papyri so that I can copy them in the Br. Mus. and that he hopes to meet me there. But as I am leaving on the morning of the 23rd it is scarcely likely that I shall be able to see him in London. Probably, however, he will be willing to leave the papyri in the B.M. until my return next summer, if you have no objection. It is much more satisfactory to copy from the originals than from photographs.</p>
            <p xml:id="p2159" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind verifying one point for me?

He wrote lately that he hopes to be in Oxford shortly and would like to see me, so I could mention it if you like.’ Bell had been responsible for compiling the bibliography for Graeco-Roman Egypt in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> since 1914. The instalment published in 1927 was signed by three contributors (Bell et al. 1927), with a note by Bell explaining the background. His promotion to Deputy Keeper in 1927 increased the difficulty of the task. The next instalment was the work of eight contributors (Milne et al. 1928); J.G. Milne was among them, but not Edgar (or Segrè). Edgar only contributed the section on ‘Publications of non-literary texts’ in the bibliography for 1932–1933 (Milne et al. 1934: 88–92), replacing Bell.</p></note></p>

Nikios was an important town midway between Naukratis and Memphis. My suggested reading of l. 60 must be wrong, but I suppose it cannot be corrected into ἐπὶ τοῦ Δέλτα.

Meyer’s καλλοινήν (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 90</ref>) seems to me rather questionable, and I do not feel much confidence in his transcriptions. He has made nonsense of no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28701">87</ref> by reading Βαιβ̣ίνης instead of the obvious βαροίνῃς (= βαρύνῃς), ‘do not burden yourself with the wedding outfit, but bring a reasonable amount’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn84" n="84"><p style="text-align: justify; "> βαρύνῃς was doubtfully conjectured by Schubart (BL 2.2.75); βαροίνῃς was read on the original much later (BL 13.105).</p></note> In no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">88</ref> again the word which he reads as ἐγαίσησες and which Wilcken amends into ἐγαὶς Ἦσες (= ὑγιὴς Ἦσις) is no doubt ἐγάμησες, as is shown by the phrase in l. 7 καὶ νῦν ὡς ἄνθρωπος τέλειος || γενάμενος ‘and now also that you are a married man’ (Hesych. τέλειοι οἱ γεγαμηκότες).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn85" n="85"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">P.Hamb. 1 88</ref> was reedited in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 556–562, who read ἐγάμησες on a photograph (BL 5.40). <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 561 accepted Meyer’s legal interpretation of τέλειος.</p></note> So I should not be surprised if he also has gone wrong over καλλοινήν.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn86" n="86"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The passage (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 1 90</ref>.5–7) was read as ὡς ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ π̣ε|ρὶ τοῦ γόμου τοῦ οἴνο̣υ, ἐ̣κλί|σθη καλῶς καὶ τὴν καλλοιν̣[ὴν   ̣  ̣  ̣  ̣] καὶ ἐ̣σφράγισα. The <ref target="http://resolver.sub.uni-hamburg.de/goobi/HANSh817">online image</ref> shows that καλλοι is possible, but there is no word beginning καλλοιν- ; the upright could also belong to nu. After that, there are traces of two letters; καλλον̣ή̣ν̣ is conceivable, but it is difficult to account for the accusative in the sequence.

            <p xml:id="p2226" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking up the passages in which ἐνοχλεῖσθαι is used of animals, I came across a curious phrase in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7495">P.Petrie II, no. 25 (a)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον ἐνοχλούμενον ἐγλοηθέν  θατα. In P.Petrie III Smyly quotes Mayser to the effect that ἐγλοηθέντα = ἐγλογηθέντα, ‘ausgeschieden’. The phrase recurs in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7496">P.P. II, no. 25 (b)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον \ἐνοχλούμενον/ ἐγλοηθέντα καὶ φλεβοτομηθέντα, but in the facsimile it seems to me that the word is clearly ἐγλουσθέντα, ‘after having received a drench and been bled.’ If you have time one day, could you verify on the originals (B.M. DLIX–X<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn96" n="96"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The actual inventory numbers are DLVIII–DLIX (558–559).</p></note>) whether my reading is right.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn97" n="97"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell pencilled, ‘probably’. Mayser’s interpretation, quoted in P.Petr. 3 61b, had also been questioned by Wilcken, who suggested that ἐγλοηθέντα stands for ἐκλουθέντα (Wilcken 1906: 519 = BL 1.360).</p></note> Mayser’s explanation strikes me as very far-fetched.</p>

            <p xml:id="p2231" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind giving me an impartial opinion on the following point?</p>
            <p xml:id="p2232" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>. The latter course would be simpler and would improve the make-up of the book. The former course would necessitate the transference of the note from the preliminary matter \(in which it is out of scale)/ to a place between the Introduction and the Texts. But is the information which it gives about the form of a typical Ptolemaic letter of sufficient interest to justify a departure from the ordinary arrangement? Or do you think that to any likely reader the information is superfluous? ||</p>
            <p xml:id="p2233" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I am in doubt myself and should in any case attach more weight to your opinion than to my own in a question of this sort.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn98" n="98"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar ultimately opted for the ‘former course’; see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, pp. 58–60 (‘The form of the papyri and the method of publication’).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p2238" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I observed lately that <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.Cairo</seg> 59415 and <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.S.I.</seg> 376 make up a nearly complete letter from Deinon dated L λϛ Υπερβερε ιζ. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn99" n="99"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The join was noted in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95113">P.Cair.Zen. 4</ref>, p. 289.

            <p xml:id="p2294" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Kelsey has just written to say that he is leaving for England about the 14th, that he is bringing over the new lot of Zenon papyri so that I can copy them in the Br. Mus. and that he hopes to meet me there. But as I am leaving on the morning of the 23rd it is scarcely likely that I shall be able to see him in London. Probably, however, he will be willing to leave the papyri in the B.M. until my return next summer, if you have no objection. It is much more satisfactory to copy from the originals than from photographs.</p>

            <p xml:id="p2299" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the offprint of your interesting publication of the new Apollonios letter.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn62" n="62"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell 1927a, republished as P. Lond. 7 1973.</p></note> I have of course no objection to Rostovtzeff making what use he pleases of the Michigan seals. There is one in the first second lot which ought to be examined by an Egyptologist; perhaps you might show it to Hall.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn63" n="63"><p style="text-align: justify; "> H. R. Hall (1873–1930) was Keeper of the Department of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities in the British Museum at that time.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p2300" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I saw Hunt last week and spoke to him about the bibliography but he was already in communication with you and was trying to find you a collaborator. Let us hope he will succeed.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn64" n="64"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Hunt had written to Bell on 31 July 1927 (BL Add. MS 59512, f. 176): ‘Segrè might be tried for bibliography if no one else at home can be got, but he always strikes me as rather inaccurate and I should prefer an Englishman if one can be found. I can’t say why || J.G. Milne won’t: he has plenty of time, surely. Another possibility occurs to me in C.C. Edgar who has just left Egypt for good. I should imagine that he is likely to settle somewhere within reach of books. He wrote lately that he hopes to be in Oxford shortly and would like to see me, so I could mention it if you like.’ Bell had been responsible for compiling the bibliography for Graeco-Roman Egypt in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> since 1914. The instalment published in 1927 was signed by three contributors (Bell et al. 1927), with a note by Bell explaining the background. His promotion to Deputy Keeper in 1927 increased the difficulty of the task. The next instalment was the work of eight contributors (Milne et al. 1928); J.G. Milne was among them, but not Edgar (or Segrè). Edgar only contributed the section on ‘Publications of non-literary texts’ in the bibliography for 1932–1933 (Milne et al. 1934: 88–92), replacing Bell.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p2301" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">At present I am compiling the Index to my catalogue, a long but unavoidable piece of drudgery, but I hope to come next week to the B.M., Tuesday or Wednesday, and put in a few || hours on the Michigan papyri. It is good news that your Ptolemaic volume is now in prospect.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn65" n="65"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell (1927a: 1) noted that ‘vol. VI of the Catalogue, … will, it is hoped, contain all the Ptolemaic papyri acquired since 1906’. This had been the plan for some time (‘Volume VI of the Museum Catalogue is likely to consist entirely of Ptolemaic texts.’ [Bell 1922: 100]), and this remained the case in the years that followed (‘vol. VI … will consist entirely of Ptolemaic papyri’ [<ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34376">Bell 1933</ref>: 514]). The project was subsequently handed over to T. C. Skeat, and the volume was numbered VII. </p></note></p>

It is true that several Ptolemaic papyri <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">not</seg> found in Zenon’s archive have been sold as part of it. It is true also that the name of Zenon continued to be prominent in Philadelphia after our Zenon’s death, like that of his partner Sostratos (see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95152">Partsch - Wilcken, Jur.

            <p xml:id="p2314" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I have not yet gone through the text very carefully but there is one suggestion which I cannot refrain from making. In l. 14 is it not possible to read ἐν] Ναυ[κρ]άτι ? If that is right, the tablets are probably an account of a voyage between Alexandria and the Fayoum. Again in l.43 could ἐν τῆι Νικίου be read? Nikios was an important town midway between Naukratis and Memphis. My suggested reading of l. 60 must be wrong, but I suppose it cannot be corrected into ἐπὶ τοῦ Δέλτα. My ἐκ in l. 75 is also wrong and ought to be ἐπὶ. In ll. 98 and 114 it || seems safe to restore = [ϲ] and [σὺν] τοῖς = ϲ.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn75" n="75"><p style="text-align: justify; "> These corrections have not been published, but Edgar gave the gist of his interpretation in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1332">P.Cair.Zen. 4 59705</ref> introd.: ‘The tablets … record a voyage up the river by way of Naukratis, Nikiou and the Delta’.</p></note></p>

Meyer’s καλλοινήν (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 90</ref>) seems to me rather questionable, and I do not feel much confidence in his transcriptions. He has made nonsense of no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28701">87</ref> by reading Βαιβ̣ίνης instead of the obvious βαροίνῃς (= βαρύνῃς), ‘do not burden yourself with the wedding outfit, but bring a reasonable amount’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn84" n="84"><p style="text-align: justify; "> βαρύνῃς was doubtfully conjectured by Schubart (BL 2.2.75); βαροίνῃς was read on the original much later (BL 13.105).</p></note> In no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">88</ref> again the word which he reads as ἐγαίσησες and which Wilcken amends into ἐγαὶς Ἦσες (= ὑγιὴς Ἦσις) is no doubt ἐγάμησες, as is shown by the phrase in l. 7 καὶ νῦν ὡς ἄνθρωπος τέλειος || γενάμενος ‘and now also that you are a married man’ (Hesych. τέλειοι οἱ γεγαμηκότες).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn85" n="85"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">P.Hamb. 1 88</ref> was reedited in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 556–562, who read ἐγάμησες on a photograph (BL 5.40). <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 561 accepted Meyer’s legal interpretation of τέλειος.</p></note> So I should not be surprised if he also has gone wrong over καλλοινήν.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn86" n="86"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The passage (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 1 90</ref>.5–7) was read as ὡς ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ π̣ε|ρὶ τοῦ γόμου τοῦ οἴνο̣υ, ἐ̣κλί|σθη καλῶς καὶ τὴν καλλοιν̣[ὴν   ̣  ̣  ̣  ̣] καὶ ἐ̣σφράγισα. The <ref target="http://resolver.sub.uni-hamburg.de/goobi/HANSh817">online image</ref> shows that καλλοι is possible, but there is no word beginning καλλοιν- ; the upright could also belong to nu. After that, there are traces of two letters; καλλον̣ή̣ν̣ is conceivable, but it is difficult to account for the accusative in the sequence. (In l. 5, read ἐνετείλ⟦λ⟧ω μοι  instead of ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ; cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/110132">P.Sijp 9_d</ref>.8.)</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p2331" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">There is a difficult phrase in one of the Zenon texts, <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2080">P.S.I. 396</ref>, τῆς προστάδος των καλαίνων οὗ   κε οἶνος κεῖται μου.

            <p xml:id="p2362" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking up the passages in which ἐνοχλεῖσθαι is used of animals, I came across a curious phrase in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7495">P.Petrie II, no. 25 (a)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον ἐνοχλούμενον ἐγλοηθέν  θατα. In P.Petrie III Smyly quotes Mayser to the effect that ἐγλοηθέντα = ἐγλογηθέντα, ‘ausgeschieden’. The phrase recurs in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7496">P.P. II, no. 25 (b)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον \ἐνοχλούμενον/ ἐγλοηθέντα καὶ φλεβοτομηθέντα, but in the facsimile it seems to me that the word is clearly ἐγλουσθέντα, ‘after having received a drench and been bled.’ If you have time one day, could you verify on the originals (B.M. DLIX–X<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn96" n="96"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The actual inventory numbers are DLVIII–DLIX (558–559).</p></note>) whether my reading is right.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn97" n="97"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell pencilled, ‘probably’. Mayser’s interpretation, quoted in P.Petr. 3 61b, had also been questioned by Wilcken, who suggested that ἐγλοηθέντα stands for ἐκλουθέντα (Wilcken 1906: 519 = BL 1.360).</p></note> Mayser’s explanation strikes me as very far-fetched.</p>

            <p xml:id="p2367" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind giving me an impartial opinion on the following point?</p>
            <p xml:id="p2368" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>. The latter course would be simpler and would improve the make-up of the book. The former course would necessitate the transference of the note from the preliminary matter \(in which it is out of scale)/ to a place between the Introduction and the Texts. But is the information which it gives about the form of a typical Ptolemaic letter of sufficient interest to justify a departure from the ordinary arrangement? Or do you think that to any likely reader the information is superfluous? ||</p>
            <p xml:id="p2369" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I am in doubt myself and should in any case attach more weight to your opinion than to my own in a question of this sort.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn98" n="98"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar ultimately opted for the ‘former course’; see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, pp. 58–60 (‘The form of the papyri and the method of publication’).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p2374" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I observed lately that <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.Cairo</seg> 59415 and <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.S.I.</seg> 376 make up a nearly complete letter from Deinon dated L λϛ Υπερβερε ιζ. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn99" n="99"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The join was noted in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95113">P.Cair.Zen. 4</ref>, p. 289.

L. 8 does not trouble me for it might be restored somewhat like this ὅτι γὰρ π[οιήσομεν δεῖ σε] νοεῖν.

            <p xml:id="p2416" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind comparing the enclosed facsimile (by our native draughtsman) of the last three lines of my no. 68 with the letter of Demetrios about the arrival of Zenon’s father at Kaunos.

            <p xml:id="p2425" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Bell,</p>
            <p xml:id="p2426" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Kelsey has just written to say that he is leaving for England about the 14th, that he is bringing over the new lot of Zenon papyri so that I can copy them in the Br. Mus. and that he hopes to meet me there. But as I am leaving on the morning of the 23rd it is scarcely likely that I shall be able to see him in London. Probably, however, he will be willing to leave the papyri in the B.M. until my return next summer, if you have no objection. It is much more satisfactory to copy from the originals than from photographs.</p>
            <p xml:id="p2427" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind verifying one point for me? In l. 14 of Mich. 3110 my copy reads, ἐ̣ν̣ τ̣ῶ̣ι̣ ὑ̣πογεγραμμένωι χρόνωι, whereas προγεγραμμένωι  seems to be the word required.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn61" n="61"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1983">P.Mich.Zen. 84</ref>.

Lond. 7 1973.</p></note> I have of course no objection to Rostovtzeff making what use he pleases of the Michigan seals.

            <p xml:id="p2432" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I saw Hunt last week and spoke to him about the bibliography but he was already in communication with you and was trying to find you a collaborator. Let us hope he will succeed.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn64" n="64"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Hunt had written to Bell on 31 July 1927 (BL Add. MS 59512, f. 176): ‘Segrè might be tried for bibliography if no one else at home can be got, but he always strikes me as rather inaccurate and I should prefer an Englishman if one can be found. I can’t say why || J.G. Milne won’t: he has plenty of time, surely. Another possibility occurs to me in C.C. Edgar who has just left Egypt for good. I should imagine that he is likely to settle somewhere within reach of books. He wrote lately that he hopes to be in Oxford shortly and would like to see me, so I could mention it if you like.’ Bell had been responsible for compiling the bibliography for Graeco-Roman Egypt in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> since 1914. The instalment published in 1927 was signed by three contributors (Bell et al. 1927), with a note by Bell explaining the background. His promotion to Deputy Keeper in 1927 increased the difficulty of the task. The next instalment was the work of eight contributors (Milne et al. 1928); J.G. Milne was among them, but not Edgar (or Segrè). Edgar only contributed the section on ‘Publications of non-literary texts’ in the bibliography for 1932–1933 (Milne et al. 1934: 88–92), replacing Bell.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p2433" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">At present I am compiling the Index to my catalogue, a long but unavoidable piece of drudgery, but I hope to come next week to the B.M., Tuesday or Wednesday, and put in a few || hours on the Michigan papyri. It is good news that your Ptolemaic volume is now in prospect.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn65" n="65"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell (1927a: 1) noted that ‘vol. VI of the Catalogue, … will, it is hoped, contain all the Ptolemaic papyri acquired since 1906’. This had been the plan for some time (‘Volume VI of the Museum Catalogue is likely to consist entirely of Ptolemaic texts.’ [Bell 1922: 100]), and this remained the case in the years that followed (‘vol. VI … will consist entirely of Ptolemaic papyri’ [<ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34376">Bell 1933</ref>: 514]). The project was subsequently handed over to T. C. Skeat, and the volume was numbered VII. </p></note></p>

It is true also that the name of Zenon continued to be prominent in Philadelphia after our Zenon’s death, like that of his partner Sostratos (see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95152">Partsch - Wilcken, Jur.

            <p xml:id="p2446" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I have not yet gone through the text very carefully but there is one suggestion which I cannot refrain from making. In l. 14 is it not possible to read ἐν] Ναυ[κρ]άτι ? If that is right, the tablets are probably an account of a voyage between Alexandria and the Fayoum. Again in l.43 could ἐν τῆι Νικίου be read? Nikios was an important town midway between Naukratis and Memphis. My suggested reading of l. 60 must be wrong, but I suppose it cannot be corrected into ἐπὶ τοῦ Δέλτα. My ἐκ in l. 75 is also wrong and ought to be ἐπὶ.

            <p xml:id="p2462" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking through some of the Hamburg papyri I came upon a reference to <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/36938">P. Lond.

Meyer’s καλλοινήν (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 90</ref>) seems to me rather questionable, and I do not feel much confidence in his transcriptions. He has made nonsense of no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28701">87</ref> by reading Βαιβ̣ίνης instead of the obvious βαροίνῃς (= βαρύνῃς), ‘do not burden yourself with the wedding outfit, but bring a reasonable amount’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn84" n="84"><p style="text-align: justify; "> βαρύνῃς was doubtfully conjectured by Schubart (BL 2.2.75); βαροίνῃς was read on the original much later (BL 13.105).</p></note> In no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">88</ref> again the word which he reads as ἐγαίσησες and which Wilcken amends into ἐγαὶς Ἦσες (= ὑγιὴς Ἦσις) is no doubt ἐγάμησες, as is shown by the phrase in l. 7 καὶ νῦν ὡς ἄνθρωπος τέλειος || γενάμενος ‘and now also that you are a married man’ (Hesych. τέλειοι οἱ γεγαμηκότες).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn85" n="85"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">P.Hamb. 1 88</ref> was reedited in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 556–562, who read ἐγάμησες on a photograph (BL 5.40). <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 561 accepted Meyer’s legal interpretation of τέλειος.</p></note> So I should not be surprised if he also has gone wrong over καλλοινήν.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn86" n="86"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The passage (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 1 90</ref>.5–7) was read as ὡς ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ π̣ε|ρὶ τοῦ γόμου τοῦ οἴνο̣υ, ἐ̣κλί|σθη καλῶς καὶ τὴν καλλοιν̣[ὴν   ̣  ̣  ̣  ̣] καὶ ἐ̣σφράγισα. The <ref target="http://resolver.sub.uni-hamburg.de/goobi/HANSh817">online image</ref> shows that καλλοι is possible, but there is no word beginning καλλοιν- ; the upright could also belong to nu. After that, there are traces of two letters; καλλον̣ή̣ν̣ is conceivable, but it is difficult to account for the accusative in the sequence. (In l. 5, read ἐνετείλ⟦λ⟧ω μοι  instead of ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ; cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/110132">P.Sijp 9_d</ref>.8.)</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p2463" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">There is a difficult phrase in one of the Zenon texts, <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2080">P.S.I. 396</ref>, τῆς προστάδος των καλαίνων οὗ   κε οἶνος κεῖται μου.

            <p xml:id="p2494" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking up the passages in which ἐνοχλεῖσθαι is used of animals, I came across a curious phrase in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7495">P.Petrie II, no. 25 (a)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον ἐνοχλούμενον ἐγλοηθέν  θατα. In P.Petrie III Smyly quotes Mayser to the effect that ἐγλοηθέντα = ἐγλογηθέντα, ‘ausgeschieden’. The phrase recurs in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7496">P.P. II, no. 25 (b)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον \ἐνοχλούμενον/ ἐγλοηθέντα καὶ φλεβοτομηθέντα, but in the facsimile it seems to me that the word is clearly ἐγλουσθέντα, ‘after having received a drench and been bled.’ If you have time one day, could you verify on the originals (B.M. DLIX–X<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn96" n="96"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The actual inventory numbers are DLVIII–DLIX (558–559).</p></note>) whether my reading is right.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn97" n="97"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell pencilled, ‘probably’. Mayser’s interpretation, quoted in P.Petr. 3 61b, had also been questioned by Wilcken, who suggested that ἐγλοηθέντα stands for ἐκλουθέντα (Wilcken 1906: 519 = BL 1.360).</p></note> Mayser’s explanation strikes me as very far-fetched.</p>

            <p xml:id="p2499" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind giving me an impartial opinion on the following point?</p>
            <p xml:id="p2500" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>. The latter course would be simpler and would improve the make-up of the book. The former course would necessitate the transference of the note from the preliminary matter \(in which it is out of scale)/ to a place between the Introduction and the Texts. But is the information which it gives about the form of a typical Ptolemaic letter of sufficient interest to justify a departure from the ordinary arrangement? Or do you think that to any likely reader the information is superfluous? ||</p>
            <p xml:id="p2501" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I am in doubt myself and should in any case attach more weight to your opinion than to my own in a question of this sort.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn98" n="98"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar ultimately opted for the ‘former course’; see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, pp. 58–60 (‘The form of the papyri and the method of publication’).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p2506" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I observed lately that <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.Cairo</seg> 59415 and <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.S.I.</seg> 376 make up a nearly complete letter from Deinon dated L λϛ Υπερβερε ιζ. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn99" n="99"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The join was noted in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95113">P.Cair.Zen. 4</ref>, p. 289.

L. 8 does not trouble me for it might be restored somewhat like this ὅτι γὰρ π[οιήσομεν δεῖ σε] νοεῖν.

            <p xml:id="p2552" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Bell,</p>
            <p xml:id="p2553" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Kelsey has just written to say that he is leaving for England about the 14th, that he is bringing over the new lot of Zenon papyri so that I can copy them in the Br. Mus. and that he hopes to meet me there. But as I am leaving on the morning of the 23rd it is scarcely likely that I shall be able to see him in London. Probably, however, he will be willing to leave the papyri in the B.M. until my return next summer, if you have no objection. It is much more satisfactory to copy from the originals than from photographs.</p>
            <p xml:id="p2554" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind verifying one point for me? In l. 14 of Mich. 3110 my copy reads, ἐ̣ν̣ τ̣ῶ̣ι̣ ὑ̣πογεγραμμένωι χρόνωι, whereas προγεγραμμένωι  seems to be the word required.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn61" n="61"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1983">P.Mich.Zen. 84</ref>.

            <p xml:id="p2559" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I saw Hunt last week and spoke to him about the bibliography but he was already in communication with you and was trying to find you a collaborator. Let us hope he will succeed.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn64" n="64"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Hunt had written to Bell on 31 July 1927 (BL Add. MS 59512, f. 176): ‘Segrè might be tried for bibliography if no one else at home can be got, but he always strikes me as rather inaccurate and I should prefer an Englishman if one can be found. I can’t say why || J.G. Milne won’t: he has plenty of time, surely. Another possibility occurs to me in C.C. Edgar who has just left Egypt for good. I should imagine that he is likely to settle somewhere within reach of books. He wrote lately that he hopes to be in Oxford shortly and would like to see me, so I could mention it if you like.’ Bell had been responsible for compiling the bibliography for Graeco-Roman Egypt in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> since 1914. The instalment published in 1927 was signed by three contributors (Bell et al. 1927), with a note by Bell explaining the background. His promotion to Deputy Keeper in 1927 increased the difficulty of the task. The next instalment was the work of eight contributors (Milne et al. 1928); J.G. Milne was among them, but not Edgar (or Segrè). Edgar only contributed the section on ‘Publications of non-literary texts’ in the bibliography for 1932–1933 (Milne et al. 1934: 88–92), replacing Bell.</p></note></p>

It is true also that the name of Zenon continued to be prominent in Philadelphia after our Zenon’s death, like that of his partner Sostratos (see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95152">Partsch - Wilcken, Jur.

In l. 14 is it not possible to read ἐν] Ναυ[κρ]άτι ? If that is right, the tablets are probably an account of a voyage between Alexandria and the Fayoum. Again in l.43 could ἐν τῆι Νικίου be read? Nikios was an important town midway between Naukratis and Memphis. My suggested reading of l. 60 must be wrong, but I suppose it cannot be corrected into ἐπὶ τοῦ Δέλτα. My ἐκ in l. 75 is also wrong and ought to be ἐπὶ.

Meyer’s καλλοινήν (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 90</ref>) seems to me rather questionable, and I do not feel much confidence in his transcriptions. He has made nonsense of no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28701">87</ref> by reading Βαιβ̣ίνης instead of the obvious βαροίνῃς (= βαρύνῃς), ‘do not burden yourself with the wedding outfit, but bring a reasonable amount’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn84" n="84"><p style="text-align: justify; "> βαρύνῃς was doubtfully conjectured by Schubart (BL 2.2.75); βαροίνῃς was read on the original much later (BL 13.105).</p></note> In no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">88</ref> again the word which he reads as ἐγαίσησες and which Wilcken amends into ἐγαὶς Ἦσες (= ὑγιὴς Ἦσις) is no doubt ἐγάμησες, as is shown by the phrase in l. 7 καὶ νῦν ὡς ἄνθρωπος τέλειος || γενάμενος ‘and now also that you are a married man’ (Hesych. τέλειοι οἱ γεγαμηκότες).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn85" n="85"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">P.Hamb. 1 88</ref> was reedited in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 556–562, who read ἐγάμησες on a photograph (BL 5.40). <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 561 accepted Meyer’s legal interpretation of τέλειος.</p></note> So I should not be surprised if he also has gone wrong over καλλοινήν.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn86" n="86"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The passage (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 1 90</ref>.5–7) was read as ὡς ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ π̣ε|ρὶ τοῦ γόμου τοῦ οἴνο̣υ, ἐ̣κλί|σθη καλῶς καὶ τὴν καλλοιν̣[ὴν   ̣  ̣  ̣  ̣] καὶ ἐ̣σφράγισα. The <ref target="http://resolver.sub.uni-hamburg.de/goobi/HANSh817">online image</ref> shows that καλλοι is possible, but there is no word beginning καλλοιν- ; the upright could also belong to nu. After that, there are traces of two letters; καλλον̣ή̣ν̣ is conceivable, but it is difficult to account for the accusative in the sequence. (In l. 5, read ἐνετείλ⟦λ⟧ω μοι  instead of ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ; cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/110132">P.Sijp 9_d</ref>.8.)</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p2590" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">There is a difficult phrase in one of the Zenon texts, <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2080">P.S.I. 396</ref>, τῆς προστάδος των καλαίνων οὗ   κε οἶνος κεῖται μου.

            <p xml:id="p2621" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking up the passages in which ἐνοχλεῖσθαι is used of animals, I came across a curious phrase in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7495">P.Petrie II, no. 25 (a)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον ἐνοχλούμενον ἐγλοηθέν  θατα. In P.Petrie III Smyly quotes Mayser to the effect that ἐγλοηθέντα = ἐγλογηθέντα, ‘ausgeschieden’. The phrase recurs in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7496">P.P. II, no. 25 (b)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον \ἐνοχλούμενον/ ἐγλοηθέντα καὶ φλεβοτομηθέντα, but in the facsimile it seems to me that the word is clearly ἐγλουσθέντα, ‘after having received a drench and been bled.’ If you have time one day, could you verify on the originals (B.M. DLIX–X<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn96" n="96"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The actual inventory numbers are DLVIII–DLIX (558–559).</p></note>) whether my reading is right.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn97" n="97"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell pencilled, ‘probably’. Mayser’s interpretation, quoted in P.Petr. 3 61b, had also been questioned by Wilcken, who suggested that ἐγλοηθέντα stands for ἐκλουθέντα (Wilcken 1906: 519 = BL 1.360).</p></note> Mayser’s explanation strikes me as very far-fetched.</p>

            <p xml:id="p2626" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind giving me an impartial opinion on the following point?</p>
            <p xml:id="p2627" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>. The latter course would be simpler and would improve the make-up of the book. The former course would necessitate the transference of the note from the preliminary matter \(in which it is out of scale)/ to a place between the Introduction and the Texts. But is the information which it gives about the form of a typical Ptolemaic letter of sufficient interest to justify a departure from the ordinary arrangement? Or do you think that to any likely reader the information is superfluous? ||</p>
            <p xml:id="p2628" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I am in doubt myself and should in any case attach more weight to your opinion than to my own in a question of this sort.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn98" n="98"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar ultimately opted for the ‘former course’; see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, pp. 58–60 (‘The form of the papyri and the method of publication’).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p2632" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the trouble you have taken about my proofs. It is satisfactory in a negative way to know that none of your fragments can be fitted on.</p>
            <p xml:id="p2633" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I observed lately that <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.Cairo</seg> 59415 and <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.S.I.</seg> 376 make up a nearly complete letter from Deinon dated L λϛ Υπερβερε ιζ. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn99" n="99"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The join was noted in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95113">P.Cair.Zen. 4</ref>, p. 289.

L. 8 does not trouble me for it might be restored somewhat like this ὅτι γὰρ π[οιήσομεν δεῖ σε] νοεῖν. The only difficulty is in l. 4, where εἰ δὴ μέν   ought to be εἰδῶμεν and Grenfell’s ]εαιει is not quite intelligible.

            <p xml:id="p2634" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I should much like to see the re-discovered Petrie papyri and hope to have an opportunity some day soon.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn102" n="102"><p style="text-align: justify; "> It is unclear what these papyri were.

            <p xml:id="p2665" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind comparing the enclosed facsimile (by our native draughtsman) of the last three lines of my no. 68 with the letter of Demetrios about the arrival of Zenon’s father at Kaunos.

            <p xml:id="p2670" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the list of division, which strikes me as quite fair and not likely to meet with much objection. Boak has just written to tell me (what you probably know already) that Kelsey has secured another good collection of Zenon papyri to be divided between Michigan and Columbia; and he very kindly offers to let me publish the Michigan share.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn57" n="57"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The matter is also mentioned in a letter from Kelsey to Bell, dated December 8, 1925; there are further details in Kelsey’s letters of 15 June, 6 July and 15 July 1925 (all in BL Add.

On 15 January 1926, Schubart wrote to Bell (BL Add.

            <p xml:id="p2675" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Kelsey has just written to say that he is leaving for England about the 14th, that he is bringing over the new lot of Zenon papyri so that I can copy them in the Br. Mus. and that he hopes to meet me there. But as I am leaving on the morning of the 23rd it is scarcely likely that I shall be able to see him in London. Probably, however, he will be willing to leave the papyri in the B.M. until my return next summer, if you have no objection. It is much more satisfactory to copy from the originals than from photographs.</p>
            <p xml:id="p2676" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind verifying one point for me?

            <p xml:id="p2681" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I saw Hunt last week and spoke to him about the bibliography but he was already in communication with you and was trying to find you a collaborator. Let us hope he will succeed.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn64" n="64"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Hunt had written to Bell on 31 July 1927 (BL Add. MS 59512, f. 176): ‘Segrè might be tried for bibliography if no one else at home can be got, but he always strikes me as rather inaccurate and I should prefer an Englishman if one can be found. I can’t say why || J.G. Milne won’t: he has plenty of time, surely. Another possibility occurs to me in C.C. Edgar who has just left Egypt for good. I should imagine that he is likely to settle somewhere within reach of books. He wrote lately that he hopes to be in Oxford shortly and would like to see me, so I could mention it if you like.’ Bell had been responsible for compiling the bibliography for Graeco-Roman Egypt in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> since 1914. The instalment published in 1927 was signed by three contributors (Bell et al. 1927), with a note by Bell explaining the background. His promotion to Deputy Keeper in 1927 increased the difficulty of the task. The next instalment was the work of eight contributors (Milne et al. 1928); J.G. Milne was among them, but not Edgar (or Segrè). Edgar only contributed the section on ‘Publications of non-literary texts’ in the bibliography for 1932–1933 (Milne et al. 1934: 88–92), replacing Bell.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p2682" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">At present I am compiling the Index to my catalogue, a long but unavoidable piece of drudgery, but I hope to come next week to the B.M., Tuesday or Wednesday, and put in a few || hours on the Michigan papyri. It is good news that your Ptolemaic volume is now in prospect.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn65" n="65"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell (1927a: 1) noted that ‘vol. VI of the Catalogue, … will, it is hoped, contain all the Ptolemaic papyri acquired since 1906’. This had been the plan for some time (‘Volume VI of the Museum Catalogue is likely to consist entirely of Ptolemaic texts.’ [Bell 1922: 100]), and this remained the case in the years that followed (‘vol. VI … will consist entirely of Ptolemaic papyri’ [<ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34376">Bell 1933</ref>: 514]). The project was subsequently handed over to T. C. Skeat, and the volume was numbered VII. </p></note></p>

It is true also that the name of Zenon continued to be prominent in Philadelphia after our Zenon’s death, like that of his partner Sostratos (see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95152">Partsch - Wilcken, Jur.

Nor is it easy to see how the Corpus Christi account fell into Zenon’s hands.

In l. 14 is it not possible to read ἐν] Ναυ[κρ]άτι ? If that is right, the tablets are probably an account of a voyage between Alexandria and the Fayoum. Again in l.43 could ἐν τῆι Νικίου be read? Nikios was an important town midway between Naukratis and Memphis. My suggested reading of l. 60 must be wrong, but I suppose it cannot be corrected into ἐπὶ τοῦ Δέλτα.

            <p xml:id="p2711" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking through some of the Hamburg papyri I came upon a reference to <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/36938">P. Lond. V., 1764</ref>, 4, τὴν τοῦ οἴνου καλλονὴν καὶ παραμονήν. Would you mind telling me if the context shows καλλονήν to mean some process of clarifying the wine, or if some other meaning is indicated. Meyer’s καλλοινήν (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 90</ref>) seems to me rather questionable, and I do not feel much confidence in his transcriptions. He has made nonsense of no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28701">87</ref> by reading Βαιβ̣ίνης instead of the obvious βαροίνῃς (= βαρύνῃς), ‘do not burden yourself with the wedding outfit, but bring a reasonable amount’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn84" n="84"><p style="text-align: justify; "> βαρύνῃς was doubtfully conjectured by Schubart (BL 2.2.75); βαροίνῃς was read on the original much later (BL 13.105).</p></note> In no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">88</ref> again the word which he reads as ἐγαίσησες and which Wilcken amends into ἐγαὶς Ἦσες (= ὑγιὴς Ἦσις) is no doubt ἐγάμησες, as is shown by the phrase in l. 7 καὶ νῦν ὡς ἄνθρωπος τέλειος || γενάμενος ‘and now also that you are a married man’ (Hesych. τέλειοι οἱ γεγαμηκότες).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn85" n="85"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">P.Hamb. 1 88</ref> was reedited in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 556–562, who read ἐγάμησες on a photograph (BL 5.40). <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 561 accepted Meyer’s legal interpretation of τέλειος.</p></note> So I should not be surprised if he also has gone wrong over καλλοινήν.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn86" n="86"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The passage (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 1 90</ref>.5–7) was read as ὡς ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ π̣ε|ρὶ τοῦ γόμου τοῦ οἴνο̣υ, ἐ̣κλί|σθη καλῶς καὶ τὴν καλλοιν̣[ὴν   ̣  ̣  ̣  ̣] καὶ ἐ̣σφράγισα. The <ref target="http://resolver.sub.uni-hamburg.de/goobi/HANSh817">online image</ref> shows that καλλοι is possible, but there is no word beginning καλλοιν- ; the upright could also belong to nu. After that, there are traces of two letters; καλλον̣ή̣ν̣ is conceivable, but it is difficult to account for the accusative in the sequence. (In l. 5, read ἐνετείλ⟦λ⟧ω μοι  instead of ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ; cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/110132">P.Sijp 9_d</ref>.8.)</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p2712" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">There is a difficult phrase in one of the Zenon texts, <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2080">P.S.I. 396</ref>, τῆς προστάδος των καλαίνων οὗ   κε οἶνος κεῖται μου. Surely καλαίνων can mean nothing but the cellars (can it be misread for καμαρίων ?),<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn87" n="87"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Later corrected to καμίνων (BL 3.223).</p></note> and it strikes me as possible that what the writer of Hamb. 90 sealed up was not the wine-jars but the deck-house in which they were loaded.

            <p xml:id="p2742" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Bell,</p>
            <p xml:id="p2743" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking up the passages in which ἐνοχλεῖσθαι is used of animals, I came across a curious phrase in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7495">P.Petrie II, no. 25 (a)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον ἐνοχλούμενον ἐγλοηθέν  θατα. In P.Petrie III Smyly quotes Mayser to the effect that ἐγλοηθέντα = ἐγλογηθέντα, ‘ausgeschieden’. The phrase recurs in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7496">P.P. II, no. 25 (b)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον \ἐνοχλούμενον/ ἐγλοηθέντα καὶ φλεβοτομηθέντα, but in the facsimile it seems to me that the word is clearly ἐγλουσθέντα, ‘after having received a drench and been bled.’ If you have time one day, could you verify on the originals (B.M. DLIX–X<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn96" n="96"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The actual inventory numbers are DLVIII–DLIX (558–559).</p></note>) whether my reading is right.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn97" n="97"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell pencilled, ‘probably’. Mayser’s interpretation, quoted in P.Petr. 3 61b, had also been questioned by Wilcken, who suggested that ἐγλοηθέντα stands for ἐκλουθέντα (Wilcken 1906: 519 = BL 1.360).</p></note> Mayser’s explanation strikes me as very far-fetched.</p>
            <p xml:id="p2744" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I hope you found the three off-prints on your table. Many thanks for the loan. </p>

            <p xml:id="p2747" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Bell,</p>
            <p xml:id="p2748" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind giving me an impartial opinion on the following point?</p>
            <p xml:id="p2749" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>. The latter course would be simpler and would improve the make-up of the book. The former course would necessitate the transference of the note from the preliminary matter \(in which it is out of scale)/ to a place between the Introduction and the Texts. But is the information which it gives about the form of a typical Ptolemaic letter of sufficient interest to justify a departure from the ordinary arrangement? Or do you think that to any likely reader the information is superfluous? ||</p>
            <p xml:id="p2750" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I am in doubt myself and should in any case attach more weight to your opinion than to my own in a question of this sort.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn98" n="98"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar ultimately opted for the ‘former course’; see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, pp. 58–60 (‘The form of the papyri and the method of publication’).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p2754" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the trouble you have taken about my proofs. It is satisfactory in a negative way to know that none of your fragments can be fitted on.</p>
            <p xml:id="p2755" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I observed lately that <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.Cairo</seg> 59415 and <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.S.I.</seg> 376 make up a nearly complete letter from Deinon dated L λϛ Υπερβερε ιζ. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn99" n="99"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The join was noted in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95113">P.Cair.Zen. 4</ref>, p. 289. The two fragments were published together in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1477">P.Cair.Zen. 5 59853</ref>.</p></note> That suggested to me that the Manchester fragment might be part of B. M. 2678, and your transcript rather confirms my suspicion.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn100" n="100"><p style="text-align: justify; "> First published in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34820">Edgar 1934</ref>: 124–125 (no. 12), and then as <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2421">P.Ryl. 4 565</ref>.</p></note> Both fragments have the same number of lines, and in several cases they fit together admirably. L. 8 does not trouble me for it might be restored somewhat like this ὅτι γὰρ π[οιήσομεν δεῖ σε] νοεῖν. The only difficulty is in l. 4, where εἰ δὴ μέν   ought to be εἰδῶμεν and Grenfell’s ]εαιει is not quite intelligible.

            <p xml:id="p2756" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I should much like to see the re-discovered Petrie papyri and hope to have an opportunity some day soon.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn102" n="102"><p style="text-align: justify; "> It is unclear what these papyri were.

            <p xml:id="p2760" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Thanks for the hand copy, which accords with Grenfell’s note ‘fine large hand’.

            <p xml:id="p2765" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Hunt has promised to do a volume (or two) of selections from the papyri for the Loeb series, but as he finds it a burden on his other work I have undertaken to do the transcriptions, translations etc, leaving the general selection to him. I feel ill qualified for the task and not very keen about it, but it is evidently desirable that he should be free to get on with his proper work; there || is no one living so good all round as he is. The little that I have done as yet makes me feel that there is a good deal to be done in the verification of readings even in well-known texts, and I should like some time to revise some of those in the B.M.</p>

            <p xml:id="p2787" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the list of division, which strikes me as quite fair and not likely to meet with much objection. Boak has just written to tell me (what you probably know already) that Kelsey has secured another good collection of Zenon papyri to be divided between Michigan and Columbia; and he very kindly offers to let me publish the Michigan share.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn57" n="57"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The matter is also mentioned in a letter from Kelsey to Bell, dated December 8, 1925; there are further details in Kelsey’s letters of 15 June, 6 July and 15 July 1925 (all in BL Add. MS 89298).</p></note> Here we have made only one acquisition, a small lot which we repurchased from Schubart at his own suggestion.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn58" n="58"><p style="text-align: justify; "> In <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95110">P.Cair.Zen. 1</ref>, p. viii, Edgar thanks ‘Grenfell, Boak and Schubart for most generously ceding to us a considerable quantity of Zenon papyri which they had themselves purchased in Cairo’. On 15 January 1926, Schubart wrote to Bell (BL Add. MS 59518, f. 120): ‘Sollten mir Zeno-Papyri zu Gesichte kommen, so werde ich Sie oder Edgar selbstverständlich benachrichtigen.’</p></note> Among the fragments is a small piece of the text which you published in the Raccolta Lumbroso, and I have put it aside to bring or send to you.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn59" n="59"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell 1925. The fragment gives the line ends of P.Lond. inv. 2096 = <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1579">P.Lond. 7 2017</ref>; it was ‘presented’ (so on the frame) to the British Museum in 1926 (cf. n. *41, on P.Lond. inv. 2312 = <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2384">P.Lond. 7 1941</ref>).</p></note> Are you coming out this year to see the work at Abydos?<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn60" n="60"><p style="text-align: justify; "> We know from his correspondence with F. W. Kelsey and W. Schubart that Bell had plans to travel to Egypt in the early months of 1926, but these did not materialize.

            <p xml:id="p2792" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Kelsey has just written to say that he is leaving for England about the 14th, that he is bringing over the new lot of Zenon papyri so that I can copy them in the Br. Mus. and that he hopes to meet me there. But as I am leaving on the morning of the 23rd it is scarcely likely that I shall be able to see him in London. Probably, however, he will be willing to leave the papyri in the B.M. until my return next summer, if you have no objection. It is much more satisfactory to copy from the originals than from photographs.</p>
            <p xml:id="p2793" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind verifying one point for me? In l. 14 of Mich. 3110 my copy reads, ἐ̣ν̣ τ̣ῶ̣ι̣ ὑ̣πογεγραμμένωι χρόνωι, whereas προγεγραμμένωι  seems to be the word required.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn61" n="61"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1983">P.Mich.Zen. 84</ref>.

            <p xml:id="p2797" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the offprint of your interesting publication of the new Apollonios letter.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn62" n="62"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell 1927a, republished as P.

Hall (1873–1930) was Keeper of the Department of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities in the British Museum at that time.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p2798" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I saw Hunt last week and spoke to him about the bibliography but he was already in communication with you and was trying to find you a collaborator. Let us hope he will succeed.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn64" n="64"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Hunt had written to Bell on 31 July 1927 (BL Add. MS 59512, f. 176): ‘Segrè might be tried for bibliography if no one else at home can be got, but he always strikes me as rather inaccurate and I should prefer an Englishman if one can be found. I can’t say why || J.G. Milne won’t: he has plenty of time, surely. Another possibility occurs to me in C.C. Edgar who has just left Egypt for good. I should imagine that he is likely to settle somewhere within reach of books. He wrote lately that he hopes to be in Oxford shortly and would like to see me, so I could mention it if you like.’ Bell had been responsible for compiling the bibliography for Graeco-Roman Egypt in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> since 1914. The instalment published in 1927 was signed by three contributors (Bell et al. 1927), with a note by Bell explaining the background. His promotion to Deputy Keeper in 1927 increased the difficulty of the task. The next instalment was the work of eight contributors (Milne et al. 1928); J.G. Milne was among them, but not Edgar (or Segrè). Edgar only contributed the section on ‘Publications of non-literary texts’ in the bibliography for 1932–1933 (Milne et al. 1934: 88–92), replacing Bell.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p2799" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">At present I am compiling the Index to my catalogue, a long but unavoidable piece of drudgery, but I hope to come next week to the B.M., Tuesday or Wednesday, and put in a few || hours on the Michigan papyri. It is good news that your Ptolemaic volume is now in prospect.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn65" n="65"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell (1927a: 1) noted that ‘vol. VI of the Catalogue, … will, it is hoped, contain all the Ptolemaic papyri acquired since 1906’. This had been the plan for some time (‘Volume VI of the Museum Catalogue is likely to consist entirely of Ptolemaic texts.’ [Bell 1922: 100]), and this remained the case in the years that followed (‘vol. VI … will consist entirely of Ptolemaic papyri’ [<ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34376">Bell 1933</ref>: 514]). The project was subsequently handed over to T. C. Skeat, and the volume was numbered VII. </p></note></p>

Nor is the text published by Hunt in the Journal<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn67" n="67"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Hunt 1926, now <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2494">P.Zen.Pestm.

Cf. <ref target="https://www.trismegistos.org/arch/archives/pdf/256.pdf">TM ArchID 256</ref>: ‘[Zenon’s] last sign of life dates from 14 February 229 (Pap. Lugd. Bat. XX Suppl.

See next letter.</p></note> Can you tell me then if there is clear evidence, either from the handwriting or from the contents, that it was really written by Zenon and not by a younger man of the same name. The former supposition seems certainly the more probable; but, as Dr. Johnson said about the evidence for the Christian religion, “Sir, I should like more.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn70" n="70"><p style="text-align: justify; "> We have not been able to identify the reference, nor do we wish to comment on Edgar’s religious beliefs (he was the son of a clergyman, and entered Oriel College as ‘Bible Clerk’ [Shadwell 1902: 677]).</p></note>”</p>

It is true that several Ptolemaic papyri <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">not</seg> found in Zenon’s archive have been sold as part of it. It is true also that the name of Zenon continued to be prominent in Philadelphia after our Zenon’s death, like that of his partner Sostratos (see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95152">Partsch - Wilcken, Jur.

Nor is it easy to see how the Corpus Christi account fell into Zenon’s hands.

In l. 14 is it not possible to read ἐν] Ναυ[κρ]άτι ? If that is right, the tablets are probably an account of a voyage between Alexandria and the Fayoum. Again in l.43 could ἐν τῆι Νικίου be read? Nikios was an important town midway between Naukratis and Memphis. My suggested reading of l. 60 must be wrong, but I suppose it cannot be corrected into ἐπὶ τοῦ Δέλτα. My ἐκ in l. 75 is also wrong and ought to be ἐπὶ.

            <p xml:id="p2828" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking through some of the Hamburg papyri I came upon a reference to <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/36938">P. Lond. V., 1764</ref>, 4, τὴν τοῦ οἴνου καλλονὴν καὶ παραμονήν. Would you mind telling me if the context shows καλλονήν to mean some process of clarifying the wine, or if some other meaning is indicated. Meyer’s καλλοινήν (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 90</ref>) seems to me rather questionable, and I do not feel much confidence in his transcriptions. He has made nonsense of no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28701">87</ref> by reading Βαιβ̣ίνης instead of the obvious βαροίνῃς (= βαρύνῃς), ‘do not burden yourself with the wedding outfit, but bring a reasonable amount’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn84" n="84"><p style="text-align: justify; "> βαρύνῃς was doubtfully conjectured by Schubart (BL 2.2.75); βαροίνῃς was read on the original much later (BL 13.105).</p></note> In no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">88</ref> again the word which he reads as ἐγαίσησες and which Wilcken amends into ἐγαὶς Ἦσες (= ὑγιὴς Ἦσις) is no doubt ἐγάμησες, as is shown by the phrase in l. 7 καὶ νῦν ὡς ἄνθρωπος τέλειος || γενάμενος ‘and now also that you are a married man’ (Hesych. τέλειοι οἱ γεγαμηκότες).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn85" n="85"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">P.Hamb. 1 88</ref> was reedited in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 556–562, who read ἐγάμησες on a photograph (BL 5.40). <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 561 accepted Meyer’s legal interpretation of τέλειος.</p></note> So I should not be surprised if he also has gone wrong over καλλοινήν.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn86" n="86"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The passage (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 1 90</ref>.5–7) was read as ὡς ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ π̣ε|ρὶ τοῦ γόμου τοῦ οἴνο̣υ, ἐ̣κλί|σθη καλῶς καὶ τὴν καλλοιν̣[ὴν   ̣  ̣  ̣  ̣] καὶ ἐ̣σφράγισα. The <ref target="http://resolver.sub.uni-hamburg.de/goobi/HANSh817">online image</ref> shows that καλλοι is possible, but there is no word beginning καλλοιν- ; the upright could also belong to nu. After that, there are traces of two letters; καλλον̣ή̣ν̣ is conceivable, but it is difficult to account for the accusative in the sequence. (In l. 5, read ἐνετείλ⟦λ⟧ω μοι  instead of ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ; cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/110132">P.Sijp 9_d</ref>.8.)</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p2829" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">There is a difficult phrase in one of the Zenon texts, <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2080">P.S.I. 396</ref>, τῆς προστάδος των καλαίνων οὗ   κε οἶνος κεῖται μου. Surely καλαίνων can mean nothing but the cellars (can it be misread for καμαρίων ?),<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn87" n="87"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Later corrected to καμίνων (BL 3.223).</p></note> and it strikes me as possible that what the writer of Hamb. 90 sealed up was not the wine-jars but the deck-house in which they were loaded.

            <p xml:id="p2865" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind giving me an impartial opinion on the following point?</p>
            <p xml:id="p2866" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>. The latter course would be simpler and would improve the make-up of the book. The former course would necessitate the transference of the note from the preliminary matter \(in which it is out of scale)/ to a place between the Introduction and the Texts.

            <p xml:id="p2877" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Thanks for the hand copy, which accords with Grenfell’s note ‘fine large hand’. I feel little doubt about the identification. ειδημεν is not a mistake for ειδωμεν or ειδησωμεν, but the pluperfect (for the form see P.S.I 445,15).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn103" n="103"><p style="text-align: justify; "> PSI 4 445 was republished in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1274">P.Cair.Zen. 4 59643</ref>.

            <p xml:id="p2882" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Hunt has promised to do a volume (or two) of selections from the papyri for the Loeb series, but as he finds it a burden on his other work I have undertaken to do the transcriptions, translations etc, leaving the general selection to him. I feel ill qualified for the task and not very keen about it, but it is evidently desirable that he should be free to get on with his proper work; there || is no one living so good all round as he is. The little that I have done as yet makes me feel that there is a good deal to be done in the verification of readings even in well-known texts, and I should like some time to revise some of those in the B.M.</p>

Besides this material there || is a large packet of papyri which rather embarrasses me. I doubt whether it would be better to bring it all to the B.M. and take out what I need from time to time or to work through it here and deposit it with you in instalments. Probably the latter method would be better as some of the material is very fragile and might be injured by being carried backwards and forwards.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn116" n="116"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3740">P.Tebt.

            <p xml:id="p2903" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Bell,</p>
            <p xml:id="p2904" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Kelsey has just written to say that he is leaving for England about the 14th, that he is bringing over the new lot of Zenon papyri so that I can copy them in the Br. Mus. and that he hopes to meet me there. But as I am leaving on the morning of the 23rd it is scarcely likely that I shall be able to see him in London. Probably, however, he will be willing to leave the papyri in the B.M. until my return next summer, if you have no objection. It is much more satisfactory to copy from the originals than from photographs.</p>
            <p xml:id="p2905" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind verifying one point for me? In l. 14 of Mich. 3110 my copy reads, ἐ̣ν̣ τ̣ῶ̣ι̣ ὑ̣πογεγραμμένωι χρόνωι, whereas προγεγραμμένωι  seems to be the word required.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn61" n="61"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1983">P.Mich.Zen. 84</ref>.

            <p xml:id="p2908" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Bell,</p>
            <p xml:id="p2909" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the offprint of your interesting publication of the new Apollonios letter.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn62" n="62"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell 1927a, republished as P. Lond. 7 1973.</p></note> I have of course no objection to Rostovtzeff making what use he pleases of the Michigan seals. There is one in the first second lot which ought to be examined by an Egyptologist; perhaps you might show it to Hall.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn63" n="63"><p style="text-align: justify; "> H. R. Hall (1873–1930) was Keeper of the Department of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities in the British Museum at that time.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p2910" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I saw Hunt last week and spoke to him about the bibliography but he was already in communication with you and was trying to find you a collaborator. Let us hope he will succeed.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn64" n="64"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Hunt had written to Bell on 31 July 1927 (BL Add. MS 59512, f. 176): ‘Segrè might be tried for bibliography if no one else at home can be got, but he always strikes me as rather inaccurate and I should prefer an Englishman if one can be found. I can’t say why || J.G. Milne won’t: he has plenty of time, surely. Another possibility occurs to me in C.C. Edgar who has just left Egypt for good. I should imagine that he is likely to settle somewhere within reach of books. He wrote lately that he hopes to be in Oxford shortly and would like to see me, so I could mention it if you like.’ Bell had been responsible for compiling the bibliography for Graeco-Roman Egypt in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> since 1914. The instalment published in 1927 was signed by three contributors (Bell et al. 1927), with a note by Bell explaining the background. His promotion to Deputy Keeper in 1927 increased the difficulty of the task. The next instalment was the work of eight contributors (Milne et al. 1928); J.G. Milne was among them, but not Edgar (or Segrè). Edgar only contributed the section on ‘Publications of non-literary texts’ in the bibliography for 1932–1933 (Milne et al. 1934: 88–92), replacing Bell.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p2911" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">At present I am compiling the Index to my catalogue, a long but unavoidable piece of drudgery, but I hope to come next week to the B.M., Tuesday or Wednesday, and put in a few || hours on the Michigan papyri. It is good news that your Ptolemaic volume is now in prospect.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn65" n="65"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell (1927a: 1) noted that ‘vol. VI of the Catalogue, … will, it is hoped, contain all the Ptolemaic papyri acquired since 1906’. This had been the plan for some time (‘Volume VI of the Museum Catalogue is likely to consist entirely of Ptolemaic texts.’ [Bell 1922: 100]), and this remained the case in the years that followed (‘vol. VI … will consist entirely of Ptolemaic papyri’ [<ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34376">Bell 1933</ref>: 514]). The project was subsequently handed over to T. C. Skeat, and the volume was numbered VII. </p></note></p>

Cf. <ref target="https://www.trismegistos.org/arch/archives/pdf/256.pdf">TM ArchID 256</ref>: ‘[Zenon’s] last sign of life dates from 14 February 229 (Pap. Lugd. Bat. XX Suppl.

See next letter.</p></note> Can you tell me then if there is clear evidence, either from the handwriting or from the contents, that it was really written by Zenon and not by a younger man of the same name. The former supposition seems certainly the more probable; but, as Dr. Johnson said about the evidence for the Christian religion, “Sir, I should like more.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn70" n="70"><p style="text-align: justify; "> We have not been able to identify the reference, nor do we wish to comment on Edgar’s religious beliefs (he was the son of a clergyman, and entered Oriel College as ‘Bible Clerk’ [Shadwell 1902: 677]).</p></note>”</p>

It is true that several Ptolemaic papyri <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">not</seg> found in Zenon’s archive have been sold as part of it. It is true also that the name of Zenon continued to be prominent in Philadelphia after our Zenon’s death, like that of his partner Sostratos (see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95152">Partsch - Wilcken, Jur. Pap.

Nor is it easy to see how the Corpus Christi account fell into Zenon’s hands. But on the || whole I must admit that at least three dated documents later than the bulk of the find do probably belong to it and that Z. did probably not die, or retire from Philadelphia, as early as I used to suppose.</p>

            <p xml:id="p2924" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I have not yet gone through the text very carefully but there is one suggestion which I cannot refrain from making. In l. 14 is it not possible to read ἐν] Ναυ[κρ]άτι ? If that is right, the tablets are probably an account of a voyage between Alexandria and the Fayoum. Again in l.43 could ἐν τῆι Νικίου be read? Nikios was an important town midway between Naukratis and Memphis. My suggested reading of l. 60 must be wrong, but I suppose it cannot be corrected into ἐπὶ τοῦ Δέλτα. My ἐκ in l. 75 is also wrong and ought to be ἐπὶ. In ll. 98 and 114 it || seems safe to restore = [ϲ] and [σὺν] τοῖς = ϲ.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn75" n="75"><p style="text-align: justify; "> These corrections have not been published, but Edgar gave the gist of his interpretation in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1332">P.Cair.Zen. 4 59705</ref> introd.: ‘The tablets … record a voyage up the river by way of Naukratis, Nikiou and the Delta’.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p2925" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I am busy at present with the proof sheets of <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95112">Zenon III</ref>, but hope to come to the Museum before long for another look at the Michigan papyri.</p>

            <p xml:id="p2940" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking through some of the Hamburg papyri I came upon a reference to <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/36938">P. Lond.

            <p xml:id="p2972" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking up the passages in which ἐνοχλεῖσθαι is used of animals, I came across a curious phrase in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7495">P.Petrie II, no. 25 (a)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον ἐνοχλούμενον ἐγλοηθέν  θατα.

II, no. 25 (b)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον \ἐνοχλούμενον/ ἐγλοηθέντα καὶ φλεβοτομηθέντα, but in the facsimile it seems to me that the word is clearly ἐγλουσθέντα, ‘after having received a drench and been bled.’ If you have time one day, could you verify on the originals (B.M.

            <p xml:id="p2977" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind giving me an impartial opinion on the following point?</p>
            <p xml:id="p2978" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>. The latter course would be simpler and would improve the make-up of the book. The former course would necessitate the transference of the note from the preliminary matter \(in which it is out of scale)/ to a place between the Introduction and the Texts. But is the information which it gives about the form of a typical Ptolemaic letter of sufficient interest to justify a departure from the ordinary arrangement? Or do you think that to any likely reader the information is superfluous? ||</p>
            <p xml:id="p2979" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I am in doubt myself and should in any case attach more weight to your opinion than to my own in a question of this sort.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn98" n="98"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar ultimately opted for the ‘former course’; see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, pp. 58–60 (‘The form of the papyri and the method of publication’).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p3007" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind verifying a reading in the letter which you published in Archiv VI, p.102?<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn110" n="110"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell 1913: 102.

            <p xml:id="p3011" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the off print of your reviews. Hasn’t Boak misunderstood the construction of ll. 9-10 of the edict? It would give better grammar to read [ὧν] in l. 9<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn112" n="112"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34390">Boak 1934</ref>: 1–8, reedited as <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/17375">P.Cair.Isid. 1</ref>, where the passage runs ἀπὸ τοῦ προτεθέντος θείου διατάγματος | καὶ τοῦ αὐτῷ συννηννωμένου βρεουίου [οἷς] τὰ ἀντίγραφα τούτου μου τοῦ διατάγματος | δημοσίᾳ προύταξα, ἔνεστιν κτλ.

Edgar’s proposed emendation, [ὧν] instead of [καί], is recorded in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> 21 (1935) 89, and was also suggested by Wilcken, but the new edition preferred Collomp’s [οἷς].</p></note> and προύταξα, ἔνεστιν πᾶσι εὖ νο[εῖ]  ν in l. 10.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn113" n="113"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/17375">P.Cair.Isid. 1</ref>.10 n. records εὖ νο[εῖ]ν as a suggestiom by Lewis.</p></note></p>

III.1–2.</p></note> and a great deal of work has been done by Hunt and Smyly also. A fair amount of commentary has already been written. Besides this material there || is a large packet of papyri which rather embarrasses me. I doubt whether it would be better to bring it all to the B.M. and take out what I need from time to time or to work through it here and deposit it with you in instalments. Probably the latter method would be better as some of the material is very fragile and might be injured by being carried backwards and forwards.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn116" n="116"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3740">P.Tebt.

            <p xml:id="p3015" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Bell,</p>
            <p xml:id="p3016" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the offprint of your interesting publication of the new Apollonios letter.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn62" n="62"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell 1927a, republished as P. Lond. 7 1973.</p></note> I have of course no objection to Rostovtzeff making what use he pleases of the Michigan seals. There is one in the first second lot which ought to be examined by an Egyptologist; perhaps you might show it to Hall.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn63" n="63"><p style="text-align: justify; "> H. R. Hall (1873–1930) was Keeper of the Department of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities in the British Museum at that time.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p3017" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I saw Hunt last week and spoke to him about the bibliography but he was already in communication with you and was trying to find you a collaborator. Let us hope he will succeed.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn64" n="64"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Hunt had written to Bell on 31 July 1927 (BL Add. MS 59512, f. 176): ‘Segrè might be tried for bibliography if no one else at home can be got, but he always strikes me as rather inaccurate and I should prefer an Englishman if one can be found. I can’t say why || J.G. Milne won’t: he has plenty of time, surely. Another possibility occurs to me in C.C. Edgar who has just left Egypt for good. I should imagine that he is likely to settle somewhere within reach of books. He wrote lately that he hopes to be in Oxford shortly and would like to see me, so I could mention it if you like.’ Bell had been responsible for compiling the bibliography for Graeco-Roman Egypt in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> since 1914. The instalment published in 1927 was signed by three contributors (Bell et al. 1927), with a note by Bell explaining the background. His promotion to Deputy Keeper in 1927 increased the difficulty of the task. The next instalment was the work of eight contributors (Milne et al. 1928); J.G. Milne was among them, but not Edgar (or Segrè).

It is true also that the name of Zenon continued to be prominent in Philadelphia after our Zenon’s death, like that of his partner Sostratos (see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95152">Partsch - Wilcken, Jur.

            <p xml:id="p3031" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I have not yet gone through the text very carefully but there is one suggestion which I cannot refrain from making. In l. 14 is it not possible to read ἐν] Ναυ[κρ]άτι ? If that is right, the tablets are probably an account of a voyage between Alexandria and the Fayoum. Again in l.43 could ἐν τῆι Νικίου be read? Nikios was an important town midway between Naukratis and Memphis. My suggested reading of l. 60 must be wrong, but I suppose it cannot be corrected into ἐπὶ τοῦ Δέλτα. My ἐκ in l. 75 is also wrong and ought to be ἐπὶ.

Meyer’s καλλοινήν (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 90</ref>) seems to me rather questionable, and I do not feel much confidence in his transcriptions. He has made nonsense of no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28701">87</ref> by reading Βαιβ̣ίνης instead of the obvious βαροίνῃς (= βαρύνῃς), ‘do not burden yourself with the wedding outfit, but bring a reasonable amount’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn84" n="84"><p style="text-align: justify; "> βαρύνῃς was doubtfully conjectured by Schubart (BL 2.2.75); βαροίνῃς was read on the original much later (BL 13.105).</p></note> In no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">88</ref> again the word which he reads as ἐγαίσησες and which Wilcken amends into ἐγαὶς Ἦσες (= ὑγιὴς Ἦσις) is no doubt ἐγάμησες, as is shown by the phrase in l. 7 καὶ νῦν ὡς ἄνθρωπος τέλειος || γενάμενος ‘and now also that you are a married man’ (Hesych. τέλειοι οἱ γεγαμηκότες).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn85" n="85"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">P.Hamb. 1 88</ref> was reedited in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 556–562, who read ἐγάμησες on a photograph (BL 5.40). <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 561 accepted Meyer’s legal interpretation of τέλειος.</p></note> So I should not be surprised if he also has gone wrong over καλλοινήν.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn86" n="86"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The passage (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 1 90</ref>.5–7) was read as ὡς ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ π̣ε|ρὶ τοῦ γόμου τοῦ οἴνο̣υ, ἐ̣κλί|σθη καλῶς καὶ τὴν καλλοιν̣[ὴν   ̣  ̣  ̣  ̣] καὶ ἐ̣σφράγισα. The <ref target="http://resolver.sub.uni-hamburg.de/goobi/HANSh817">online image</ref> shows that καλλοι is possible, but there is no word beginning καλλοιν- ; the upright could also belong to nu. After that, there are traces of two letters; καλλον̣ή̣ν̣ is conceivable, but it is difficult to account for the accusative in the sequence.

            <p xml:id="p3079" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking up the passages in which ἐνοχλεῖσθαι is used of animals, I came across a curious phrase in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7495">P.Petrie II, no. 25 (a)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον ἐνοχλούμενον ἐγλοηθέν  θατα. In P.Petrie III Smyly quotes Mayser to the effect that ἐγλοηθέντα = ἐγλογηθέντα, ‘ausgeschieden’. The phrase recurs in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7496">P.P. II, no. 25 (b)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον \ἐνοχλούμενον/ ἐγλοηθέντα καὶ φλεβοτομηθέντα, but in the facsimile it seems to me that the word is clearly ἐγλουσθέντα, ‘after having received a drench and been bled.’ If you have time one day, could you verify on the originals (B.M. DLIX–X<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn96" n="96"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The actual inventory numbers are DLVIII–DLIX (558–559).</p></note>) whether my reading is right.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn97" n="97"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell pencilled, ‘probably’. Mayser’s interpretation, quoted in P.Petr. 3 61b, had also been questioned by Wilcken, who suggested that ἐγλοηθέντα stands for ἐκλουθέντα (Wilcken 1906: 519 = BL 1.360).</p></note> Mayser’s explanation strikes me as very far-fetched.</p>

            <p xml:id="p3084" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind giving me an impartial opinion on the following point?</p>
            <p xml:id="p3085" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>. The latter course would be simpler and would improve the make-up of the book. The former course would necessitate the transference of the note from the preliminary matter \(in which it is out of scale)/ to a place between the Introduction and the Texts. But is the information which it gives about the form of a typical Ptolemaic letter of sufficient interest to justify a departure from the ordinary arrangement? Or do you think that to any likely reader the information is superfluous? ||</p>
            <p xml:id="p3086" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I am in doubt myself and should in any case attach more weight to your opinion than to my own in a question of this sort.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn98" n="98"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar ultimately opted for the ‘former course’; see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, pp. 58–60 (‘The form of the papyri and the method of publication’).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p3090" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the trouble you have taken about my proofs. It is satisfactory in a negative way to know that none of your fragments can be fitted on.</p>
            <p xml:id="p3091" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I observed lately that <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.Cairo</seg> 59415 and <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.S.I.</seg> 376 make up a nearly complete letter from Deinon dated L λϛ Υπερβερε ιζ. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn99" n="99"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The join was noted in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95113">P.Cair.Zen. 4</ref>, p. 289.

L. 8 does not trouble me for it might be restored somewhat like this ὅτι γὰρ π[οιήσομεν δεῖ σε] νοεῖν. The only difficulty is in l. 4, where εἰ δὴ μέν   ought to be εἰδῶμεν and Grenfell’s ]εαιει is not quite intelligible.

            <p xml:id="p3092" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I should much like to see the re-discovered Petrie papyri and hope to have an opportunity some day soon.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn102" n="102"><p style="text-align: justify; "> It is unclear what these papyri were.

            <p xml:id="p3123" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">On studying P. Mich.

Nor is the text published by Hunt in the Journal<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn67" n="67"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Hunt 1926, now <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2494">P.Zen.Pestm.

Cf. <ref target="https://www.trismegistos.org/arch/archives/pdf/256.pdf">TM ArchID 256</ref>: ‘[Zenon’s] last sign of life dates from 14 February 229 (Pap. Lugd. Bat. XX Suppl. E, a text which is arguably part of the archive).’</p></note> But the letter to Achoapis in your collection may be decisive.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn69" n="69"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1581">P.Lond. 7 2019</ref>. See next letter.</p></note> Can you tell me then if there is clear evidence, either from the handwriting or from the contents, that it was really written by Zenon and not by a younger man of the same name. The former supposition seems certainly the more probable; but, as Dr. Johnson said about the evidence for the Christian religion, “Sir, I should like more.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn70" n="70"><p style="text-align: justify; "> We have not been able to identify the reference, nor do we wish to comment on Edgar’s religious beliefs (he was the son of a clergyman, and entered Oriel College as ‘Bible Clerk’ [Shadwell 1902: 677]).</p></note>”</p>

            <p xml:id="p3127" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the copy of the letter to Achoapis.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn71" n="71"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1581">P.Lond. 7 2019</ref>.</p></note> It does evidently hang together with the Corpus Christi account,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn72" n="72"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Hunt 1926, now <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2494">P.Zen.Pestm.

It is true that several Ptolemaic papyri <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">not</seg> found in Zenon’s archive have been sold as part of it. It is true also that the name of Zenon continued to be prominent in Philadelphia after our Zenon’s death, like that of his partner Sostratos (see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95152">Partsch - Wilcken, Jur. Pap.

Nor is it easy to see how the Corpus Christi account fell into Zenon’s hands. But on the || whole I must admit that at least three dated documents later than the bulk of the find do probably belong to it and that Z. did probably not die, or retire from Philadelphia, as early as I used to suppose.</p>

            <p xml:id="p3131" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for your paper on the waxed tablets together with Petrie’s commentary.

            <p xml:id="p3132" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I have not yet gone through the text very carefully but there is one suggestion which I cannot refrain from making. In l. 14 is it not possible to read ἐν] Ναυ[κρ]άτι ? If that is right, the tablets are probably an account of a voyage between Alexandria and the Fayoum. Again in l.43 could ἐν τῆι Νικίου be read? Nikios was an important town midway between Naukratis and Memphis. My suggested reading of l. 60 must be wrong, but I suppose it cannot be corrected into ἐπὶ τοῦ Δέλτα. My ἐκ in l. 75 is also wrong and ought to be ἐπὶ. In ll. 98 and 114 it || seems safe to restore = [ϲ] and [σὺν] τοῖς = ϲ.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn75" n="75"><p style="text-align: justify; "> These corrections have not been published, but Edgar gave the gist of his interpretation in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1332">P.Cair.Zen. 4 59705</ref> introd.: ‘The tablets … record a voyage up the river by way of Naukratis, Nikiou and the Delta’.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p3133" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I am busy at present with the proof sheets of <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95112">Zenon III</ref>, but hope to come to the Museum before long for another look at the Michigan papyri.</p>

Moreover it is quite good Greek and gives just the sense required ‘that his land is the one and only that gets no water’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn77" n="77"><p style="text-align: justify; "> μόνω[ι ἐπὶ σ]οί had been suggested by Wilcken 1927: 278. μονωτάτ̣η first appeared in Edgar 1920: 14 n. 1, and was restated in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, p. 26 n. 1.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p3138" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Your reading τ . . . αφ[ . ]ειν suggests to me a new interpretation. From the facsimile I think I can see a ν before αφ and read τ . ναφ . . ιν.

            <p xml:id="p3142" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">So far as I am concerned, you may have the Michigan papyri packed up. A few passages still baffle me, but I must abandon them as unsolved problems. </p>

Comparing κατασκευᾶι τοὺς ἀγκῶνας in l. 2 I am much tempted to restore ἀγκωνίζειν or ἀγκωνίσαι, which would give exactly the required sense.

            <p xml:id="p3147" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Bell,</p>
            <p xml:id="p3148" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking through some of the Hamburg papyri I came upon a reference to <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/36938">P. Lond. V., 1764</ref>, 4, τὴν τοῦ οἴνου καλλονὴν καὶ παραμονήν. Would you mind telling me if the context shows καλλονήν to mean some process of clarifying the wine, or if some other meaning is indicated. Meyer’s καλλοινήν (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 90</ref>) seems to me rather questionable, and I do not feel much confidence in his transcriptions. He has made nonsense of no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28701">87</ref> by reading Βαιβ̣ίνης instead of the obvious βαροίνῃς (= βαρύνῃς), ‘do not burden yourself with the wedding outfit, but bring a reasonable amount’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn84" n="84"><p style="text-align: justify; "> βαρύνῃς was doubtfully conjectured by Schubart (BL 2.2.75); βαροίνῃς was read on the original much later (BL 13.105).</p></note> In no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">88</ref> again the word which he reads as ἐγαίσησες and which Wilcken amends into ἐγαὶς Ἦσες (= ὑγιὴς Ἦσις) is no doubt ἐγάμησες, as is shown by the phrase in l. 7 καὶ νῦν ὡς ἄνθρωπος τέλειος || γενάμενος ‘and now also that you are a married man’ (Hesych. τέλειοι οἱ γεγαμηκότες).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn85" n="85"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">P.Hamb. 1 88</ref> was reedited in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 556–562, who read ἐγάμησες on a photograph (BL 5.40). <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 561 accepted Meyer’s legal interpretation of τέλειος.</p></note> So I should not be surprised if he also has gone wrong over καλλοινήν.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn86" n="86"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The passage (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 1 90</ref>.5–7) was read as ὡς ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ π̣ε|ρὶ τοῦ γόμου τοῦ οἴνο̣υ, ἐ̣κλί|σθη καλῶς καὶ τὴν καλλοιν̣[ὴν   ̣  ̣  ̣  ̣] καὶ ἐ̣σφράγισα. The <ref target="http://resolver.sub.uni-hamburg.de/goobi/HANSh817">online image</ref> shows that καλλοι is possible, but there is no word beginning καλλοιν- ; the upright could also belong to nu. After that, there are traces of two letters; καλλον̣ή̣ν̣ is conceivable, but it is difficult to account for the accusative in the sequence. (In l. 5, read ἐνετείλ⟦λ⟧ω μοι  instead of ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ; cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/110132">P.Sijp 9_d</ref>.8.)</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p3149" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">There is a difficult phrase in one of the Zenon texts, <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2080">P.S.I. 396</ref>, τῆς προστάδος των καλαίνων οὗ   κε οἶνος κεῖται μου. Surely καλαίνων can mean nothing but the cellars (can it be misread for καμαρίων ?),<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn87" n="87"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Later corrected to καμίνων (BL 3.223).</p></note> and it strikes me as possible that what the writer of Hamb. 90 sealed up was not the wine-jars but the deck-house in which they were loaded.

            <p xml:id="p3154" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If the Petrie papyrus DXX (= <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7650">P.Petr.

The word in l. 4 which I read with some hesitation as στομ̣ωτ̣ήν would probably give a clue to the meaning if correctly deciphered. If στομωτήν is right, the object of χορηγεῖν would naturally be σκαφεῖα. Enclosed is a very provisional attempt at a restoration.</p>

            <p xml:id="p3180" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking up the passages in which ἐνοχλεῖσθαι is used of animals, I came across a curious phrase in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7495">P.Petrie II, no. 25 (a)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον ἐνοχλούμενον ἐγλοηθέν  θατα. In P.Petrie III Smyly quotes Mayser to the effect that ἐγλοηθέντα = ἐγλογηθέντα, ‘ausgeschieden’. The phrase recurs in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7496">P.P. II, no. 25 (b)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον \ἐνοχλούμενον/ ἐγλοηθέντα καὶ φλεβοτομηθέντα, but in the facsimile it seems to me that the word is clearly ἐγλουσθέντα, ‘after having received a drench and been bled.’ If you have time one day, could you verify on the originals (B.M. DLIX–X<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn96" n="96"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The actual inventory numbers are DLVIII–DLIX (558–559).</p></note>) whether my reading is right.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn97" n="97"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell pencilled, ‘probably’. Mayser’s interpretation, quoted in P.Petr. 3 61b, had also been questioned by Wilcken, who suggested that ἐγλοηθέντα stands for ἐκλουθέντα (Wilcken 1906: 519 = BL 1.360).</p></note> Mayser’s explanation strikes me as very far-fetched.</p>

            <p xml:id="p3185" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind giving me an impartial opinion on the following point?</p>
            <p xml:id="p3186" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>. The latter course would be simpler and would improve the make-up of the book. The former course would necessitate the transference of the note from the preliminary matter \(in which it is out of scale)/ to a place between the Introduction and the Texts. But is the information which it gives about the form of a typical Ptolemaic letter of sufficient interest to justify a departure from the ordinary arrangement? Or do you think that to any likely reader the information is superfluous? ||</p>
            <p xml:id="p3187" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I am in doubt myself and should in any case attach more weight to your opinion than to my own in a question of this sort.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn98" n="98"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar ultimately opted for the ‘former course’; see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, pp. 58–60 (‘The form of the papyri and the method of publication’).</p></note></p>

Ἱε]ροκλέους was printed in Sel. Pap. 1 34.15 (not in BL).</p></note> I cannot judge from the facsimile. Divine names at this period seem to me rather suspect. There is an Ἀπόλλων in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/3216">P.Lille 9</ref>,2; but if you look at the plate, you will see that the right reading is παρὰ Πολέμωνος .<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn107" n="107"><p style="text-align: justify; "> [π]αρὰ Πολέμωνος has now been read by <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/86739">Clarysse 2013</ref>: 266 n. 11.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p3202" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Hunt has promised to do a volume (or two) of selections from the papyri for the Loeb series, but as he finds it a burden on his other work I have undertaken to do the transcriptions, translations etc, leaving the general selection to him. I feel ill qualified for the task and not very keen about it, but it is evidently desirable that he should be free to get on with his proper work; there || is no one living so good all round as he is. The little that I have done as yet makes me feel that there is a good deal to be done in the verification of readings even in well-known texts, and I should like some time to revise some of those in the B.M.</p>

            <p xml:id="p3215" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind verifying a reading in the letter which you published in Archiv VI, p.102?<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn110" n="110"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell 1913: 102.

Is it quite clear or would it be possible to read τὸ δ’? If τοῦ is certain Hunt suggests ἐπιλ[έξαντος in l. 8, which would do equally well and  obviate the necessity of supposing τοῦ to be a mistake of the scribe for καί.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn111" n="111"><p style="text-align: justify; "> ἐπιλ[έξαντος was printed in Sel.

            <p xml:id="p3219" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the off print of your reviews. Hasn’t Boak misunderstood the construction of ll. 9-10 of the edict? It would give better grammar to read [ὧν] in l. 9<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn112" n="112"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34390">Boak 1934</ref>: 1–8, reedited as <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/17375">P.Cair.Isid. 1</ref>, where the passage runs ἀπὸ τοῦ προτεθέντος θείου διατάγματος | καὶ τοῦ αὐτῷ συννηννωμένου βρεουίου [οἷς] τὰ ἀντίγραφα τούτου μου τοῦ διατάγματος | δημοσίᾳ προύταξα, ἔνεστιν κτλ.

Edgar’s proposed emendation, [ὧν] instead of [καί], is recorded in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> 21 (1935) 89, and was also suggested by Wilcken, but the new edition preferred Collomp’s [οἷς].</p></note> and προύταξα, ἔνεστιν πᾶσι εὖ νο[εῖ]  ν in l. 10.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn113" n="113"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/17375">P.Cair.Isid. 1</ref>.10 n. records εὖ νο[εῖ]ν as a suggestiom by Lewis.</p></note></p>

Grenfell seems to have transcribed almost everything<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn115" n="115"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Grenfell’s input is mentioned in the preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3137">P.Tebt. III.1</ref>, but not exactly in these terms. It would be fair to say that without Grenfell’s transcriptions there would have been no P.Tebt. III.1–2.</p></note> and a great deal of work has been done by Hunt and Smyly also. A fair amount of commentary has already been written. Besides this material there || is a large packet of papyri which rather embarrasses me. I doubt whether it would be better to bring it all to the B.M. and take out what I need from time to time or to work through it here and deposit it with you in instalments. Probably the latter method would be better as some of the material is very fragile and might be injured by being carried backwards and forwards.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn116" n="116"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3740">P.Tebt. III.2</ref> reports that ‘Early in 1935 the papyri were removed from Oxford and temporarily stored in the British Museum’.</p></note></p>

It is true that several Ptolemaic papyri <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">not</seg> found in Zenon’s archive have been sold as part of it. It is true also that the name of Zenon continued to be prominent in Philadelphia after our Zenon’s death, like that of his partner Sostratos (see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95152">Partsch - Wilcken, Jur.

Nor is it easy to see how the Corpus Christi account fell into Zenon’s hands. But on the || whole I must admit that at least three dated documents later than the bulk of the find do probably belong to it and that Z. did probably not die, or retire from Philadelphia, as early as I used to suppose.</p>

            <p xml:id="p3229" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I have not yet gone through the text very carefully but there is one suggestion which I cannot refrain from making. In l. 14 is it not possible to read ἐν] Ναυ[κρ]άτι ? If that is right, the tablets are probably an account of a voyage between Alexandria and the Fayoum. Again in l.43 could ἐν τῆι Νικίου be read? Nikios was an important town midway between Naukratis and Memphis. My suggested reading of l. 60 must be wrong, but I suppose it cannot be corrected into ἐπὶ τοῦ Δέλτα. My ἐκ in l. 75 is also wrong and ought to be ἐπὶ.

            <p xml:id="p3245" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking through some of the Hamburg papyri I came upon a reference to <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/36938">P. Lond. V., 1764</ref>, 4, τὴν τοῦ οἴνου καλλονὴν καὶ παραμονήν. Would you mind telling me if the context shows καλλονήν to mean some process of clarifying the wine, or if some other meaning is indicated. Meyer’s καλλοινήν (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 90</ref>) seems to me rather questionable, and I do not feel much confidence in his transcriptions. He has made nonsense of no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28701">87</ref> by reading Βαιβ̣ίνης instead of the obvious βαροίνῃς (= βαρύνῃς), ‘do not burden yourself with the wedding outfit, but bring a reasonable amount’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn84" n="84"><p style="text-align: justify; "> βαρύνῃς was doubtfully conjectured by Schubart (BL 2.2.75); βαροίνῃς was read on the original much later (BL 13.105).</p></note> In no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">88</ref> again the word which he reads as ἐγαίσησες and which Wilcken amends into ἐγαὶς Ἦσες (= ὑγιὴς Ἦσις) is no doubt ἐγάμησες, as is shown by the phrase in l. 7 καὶ νῦν ὡς ἄνθρωπος τέλειος || γενάμενος ‘and now also that you are a married man’ (Hesych. τέλειοι οἱ γεγαμηκότες).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn85" n="85"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">P.Hamb. 1 88</ref> was reedited in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 556–562, who read ἐγάμησες on a photograph (BL 5.40). <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 561 accepted Meyer’s legal interpretation of τέλειος.</p></note> So I should not be surprised if he also has gone wrong over καλλοινήν.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn86" n="86"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The passage (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 1 90</ref>.5–7) was read as ὡς ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ π̣ε|ρὶ τοῦ γόμου τοῦ οἴνο̣υ, ἐ̣κλί|σθη καλῶς καὶ τὴν καλλοιν̣[ὴν   ̣  ̣  ̣  ̣] καὶ ἐ̣σφράγισα. The <ref target="http://resolver.sub.uni-hamburg.de/goobi/HANSh817">online image</ref> shows that καλλοι is possible, but there is no word beginning καλλοιν- ; the upright could also belong to nu. After that, there are traces of two letters; καλλον̣ή̣ν̣ is conceivable, but it is difficult to account for the accusative in the sequence. (In l. 5, read ἐνετείλ⟦λ⟧ω μοι  instead of ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ; cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/110132">P.Sijp 9_d</ref>.8.)</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p3246" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">There is a difficult phrase in one of the Zenon texts, <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2080">P.S.I. 396</ref>, τῆς προστάδος των καλαίνων οὗ   κε οἶνος κεῖται μου. Surely καλαίνων can mean nothing but the cellars (can it be misread for καμαρίων ?),<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn87" n="87"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Later corrected to καμίνων (BL 3.223).</p></note> and it strikes me as possible that what the writer of Hamb. 90 sealed up was not the wine-jars but the deck-house in which they were loaded.

II, no. 25 (b)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον \ἐνοχλούμενον/ ἐγλοηθέντα καὶ φλεβοτομηθέντα, but in the facsimile it seems to me that the word is clearly ἐγλουσθέντα, ‘after having received a drench and been bled.’ If you have time one day, could you verify on the originals (B.M. DLIX–X<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn96" n="96"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The actual inventory numbers are DLVIII–DLIX (558–559).</p></note>) whether my reading is right.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn97" n="97"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell pencilled, ‘probably’. Mayser’s interpretation, quoted in P.Petr. 3 61b, had also been questioned by Wilcken, who suggested that ἐγλοηθέντα stands for ἐκλουθέντα (Wilcken 1906: 519 = BL 1.360).</p></note> Mayser’s explanation strikes me as very far-fetched.</p>

            <p xml:id="p3281" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Bell,</p>
            <p xml:id="p3282" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind giving me an impartial opinion on the following point?</p>
            <p xml:id="p3283" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>. The latter course would be simpler and would improve the make-up of the book. The former course would necessitate the transference of the note from the preliminary matter \(in which it is out of scale)/ to a place between the Introduction and the Texts. But is the information which it gives about the form of a typical Ptolemaic letter of sufficient interest to justify a departure from the ordinary arrangement? Or do you think that to any likely reader the information is superfluous? ||</p>
            <p xml:id="p3284" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I am in doubt myself and should in any case attach more weight to your opinion than to my own in a question of this sort.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn98" n="98"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar ultimately opted for the ‘former course’; see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, pp. 58–60 (‘The form of the papyri and the method of publication’).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p3288" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the trouble you have taken about my proofs. It is satisfactory in a negative way to know that none of your fragments can be fitted on.</p>
            <p xml:id="p3289" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I observed lately that <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.Cairo</seg> 59415 and <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.S.I.</seg> 376 make up a nearly complete letter from Deinon dated L λϛ Υπερβερε ιζ. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn99" n="99"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The join was noted in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95113">P.Cair.Zen. 4</ref>, p. 289.

L. 8 does not trouble me for it might be restored somewhat like this ὅτι γὰρ π[οιήσομεν δεῖ σε] νοεῖν. The only difficulty is in l. 4, where εἰ δὴ μέν   ought to be εἰδῶμεν and Grenfell’s ]εαιει is not quite intelligible.

            <p xml:id="p3290" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I should much like to see the re-discovered Petrie papyri and hope to have an opportunity some day soon.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn102" n="102"><p style="text-align: justify; "> It is unclear what these papyri were.

            <p xml:id="p3299" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Hunt has promised to do a volume (or two) of selections from the papyri for the Loeb series, but as he finds it a burden on his other work I have undertaken to do the transcriptions, translations etc, leaving the general selection to him. I feel ill qualified for the task and not very keen about it, but it is evidently desirable that he should be free to get on with his proper work; there || is no one living so good all round as he is. The little that I have done as yet makes me feel that there is a good deal to be done in the verification of readings even in well-known texts, and I should like some time to revise some of those in the B.M.</p>

            <p xml:id="p3321" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for your paper on the waxed tablets together with Petrie’s commentary. It is a pleasure to see how bright his imagination still is.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn74" n="74"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/96806">Bell 1927b</ref>, now <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/5692">SB 4 7451</ref> (= C.Ptol.Sklav.

            <p xml:id="p3322" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I have not yet gone through the text very carefully but there is one suggestion which I cannot refrain from making. In l. 14 is it not possible to read ἐν] Ναυ[κρ]άτι ? If that is right, the tablets are probably an account of a voyage between Alexandria and the Fayoum. Again in l.43 could ἐν τῆι Νικίου be read? Nikios was an important town midway between Naukratis and Memphis. My suggested reading of l. 60 must be wrong, but I suppose it cannot be corrected into ἐπὶ τοῦ Δέλτα. My ἐκ in l. 75 is also wrong and ought to be ἐπὶ. In ll. 98 and 114 it || seems safe to restore = [ϲ] and [σὺν] τοῖς = ϲ.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn75" n="75"><p style="text-align: justify; "> These corrections have not been published, but Edgar gave the gist of his interpretation in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1332">P.Cair.Zen. 4 59705</ref> introd.: ‘The tablets … record a voyage up the river by way of Naukratis, Nikiou and the Delta’.</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p3327" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Yes, I had already looked at the facsimile of P.Petrie II, 13 (5)<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn76" n="76"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2492">P.Zen.Pestm.

Moreover it is quite good Greek and gives just the sense required ‘that his land is the one and only that gets no water’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn77" n="77"><p style="text-align: justify; "> μόνω[ι ἐπὶ σ]οί had been suggested by Wilcken 1927: 278. μονωτάτ̣η first appeared in Edgar 1920: 14 n. 1, and was restated in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, p. 26 n. 1.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p3328" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Your reading τ . . . αφ[ . ]ειν suggests to me a new interpretation.

Comparing κατασκευᾶι τοὺς ἀγκῶνας in l. 2 I am much tempted to restore ἀγκωνίζειν or ἀγκωνίσαι, which would give exactly the required sense.

            <p xml:id="p3338" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking through some of the Hamburg papyri I came upon a reference to <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/36938">P. Lond. V., 1764</ref>, 4, τὴν τοῦ οἴνου καλλονὴν καὶ παραμονήν. Would you mind telling me if the context shows καλλονήν to mean some process of clarifying the wine, or if some other meaning is indicated. Meyer’s καλλοινήν (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 90</ref>) seems to me rather questionable, and I do not feel much confidence in his transcriptions. He has made nonsense of no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28701">87</ref> by reading Βαιβ̣ίνης instead of the obvious βαροίνῃς (= βαρύνῃς), ‘do not burden yourself with the wedding outfit, but bring a reasonable amount’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn84" n="84"><p style="text-align: justify; "> βαρύνῃς was doubtfully conjectured by Schubart (BL 2.2.75); βαροίνῃς was read on the original much later (BL 13.105).</p></note> In no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">88</ref> again the word which he reads as ἐγαίσησες and which Wilcken amends into ἐγαὶς Ἦσες (= ὑγιὴς Ἦσις) is no doubt ἐγάμησες, as is shown by the phrase in l. 7 καὶ νῦν ὡς ἄνθρωπος τέλειος || γενάμενος ‘and now also that you are a married man’ (Hesych. τέλειοι οἱ γεγαμηκότες).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn85" n="85"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">P.Hamb. 1 88</ref> was reedited in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 556–562, who read ἐγάμησες on a photograph (BL 5.40). <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 561 accepted Meyer’s legal interpretation of τέλειος.</p></note> So I should not be surprised if he also has gone wrong over καλλοινήν.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn86" n="86"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The passage (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 1 90</ref>.5–7) was read as ὡς ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ π̣ε|ρὶ τοῦ γόμου τοῦ οἴνο̣υ, ἐ̣κλί|σθη καλῶς καὶ τὴν καλλοιν̣[ὴν   ̣  ̣  ̣  ̣] καὶ ἐ̣σφράγισα. The <ref target="http://resolver.sub.uni-hamburg.de/goobi/HANSh817">online image</ref> shows that καλλοι is possible, but there is no word beginning καλλοιν- ; the upright could also belong to nu. After that, there are traces of two letters; καλλον̣ή̣ν̣ is conceivable, but it is difficult to account for the accusative in the sequence. (In l. 5, read ἐνετείλ⟦λ⟧ω μοι  instead of ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ; cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/110132">P.Sijp 9_d</ref>.8.)</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p3339" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">There is a difficult phrase in one of the Zenon texts, <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2080">P.S.I. 396</ref>, τῆς προστάδος των καλαίνων οὗ   κε οἶνος κεῖται μου. Surely καλαίνων can mean nothing but the cellars (can it be misread for καμαρίων ?),<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn87" n="87"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Later corrected to καμίνων (BL 3.223).</p></note> and it strikes me as possible that what the writer of Hamb. 90 sealed up was not the wine-jars but the deck-house in which they were loaded. Or can you give me a more satisfactory explanation?</p>

            <p xml:id="p3344" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If the Petrie papyrus DXX (= <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7650">P.Petr.

The word in l. 4 which I read with some hesitation as στομ̣ωτ̣ήν would probably give a clue to the meaning if correctly deciphered. If στομωτήν is right, the object of χορηγεῖν would naturally be σκαφεῖα. Enclosed is a very provisional attempt at a restoration.</p>

            <p xml:id="p3370" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking up the passages in which ἐνοχλεῖσθαι is used of animals, I came across a curious phrase in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7495">P.Petrie II, no. 25 (a)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον ἐνοχλούμενον ἐγλοηθέν  θατα. In P.Petrie III Smyly quotes Mayser to the effect that ἐγλοηθέντα = ἐγλογηθέντα, ‘ausgeschieden’. The phrase recurs in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7496">P.P. II, no. 25 (b)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον \ἐνοχλούμενον/ ἐγλοηθέντα καὶ φλεβοτομηθέντα, but in the facsimile it seems to me that the word is clearly ἐγλουσθέντα, ‘after having received a drench and been bled.’ If you have time one day, could you verify on the originals (B.M. DLIX–X<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn96" n="96"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The actual inventory numbers are DLVIII–DLIX (558–559).</p></note>) whether my reading is right.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn97" n="97"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell pencilled, ‘probably’. Mayser’s interpretation, quoted in P.Petr. 3 61b, had also been questioned by Wilcken, who suggested that ἐγλοηθέντα stands for ἐκλουθέντα (Wilcken 1906: 519 = BL 1.360).</p></note> Mayser’s explanation strikes me as very far-fetched.</p>

            <p xml:id="p3375" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind giving me an impartial opinion on the following point?</p>
            <p xml:id="p3376" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>. The latter course would be simpler and would improve the make-up of the book. The former course would necessitate the transference of the note from the preliminary matter \(in which it is out of scale)/ to a place between the Introduction and the Texts. But is the information which it gives about the form of a typical Ptolemaic letter of sufficient interest to justify a departure from the ordinary arrangement? Or do you think that to any likely reader the information is superfluous? ||</p>
            <p xml:id="p3377" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I am in doubt myself and should in any case attach more weight to your opinion than to my own in a question of this sort.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn98" n="98"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar ultimately opted for the ‘former course’; see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, pp. 58–60 (‘The form of the papyri and the method of publication’).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p3382" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I observed lately that <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.Cairo</seg> 59415 and <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.S.I.</seg> 376 make up a nearly complete letter from Deinon dated L λϛ Υπερβερε ιζ. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn99" n="99"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The join was noted in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95113">P.Cair.Zen. 4</ref>, p. 289.

            <p xml:id="p3424" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Bell,</p>
            <p xml:id="p3425" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking through some of the Hamburg papyri I came upon a reference to <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/36938">P. Lond. V., 1764</ref>, 4, τὴν τοῦ οἴνου καλλονὴν καὶ παραμονήν. Would you mind telling me if the context shows καλλονήν to mean some process of clarifying the wine, or if some other meaning is indicated. Meyer’s καλλοινήν (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 90</ref>) seems to me rather questionable, and I do not feel much confidence in his transcriptions. He has made nonsense of no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28701">87</ref> by reading Βαιβ̣ίνης instead of the obvious βαροίνῃς (= βαρύνῃς), ‘do not burden yourself with the wedding outfit, but bring a reasonable amount’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn84" n="84"><p style="text-align: justify; "> βαρύνῃς was doubtfully conjectured by Schubart (BL 2.2.75); βαροίνῃς was read on the original much later (BL 13.105).</p></note> In no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">88</ref> again the word which he reads as ἐγαίσησες and which Wilcken amends into ἐγαὶς Ἦσες (= ὑγιὴς Ἦσις) is no doubt ἐγάμησες, as is shown by the phrase in l. 7 καὶ νῦν ὡς ἄνθρωπος τέλειος || γενάμενος ‘and now also that you are a married man’ (Hesych. τέλειοι οἱ γεγαμηκότες).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn85" n="85"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">P.Hamb. 1 88</ref> was reedited in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 556–562, who read ἐγάμησες on a photograph (BL 5.40). <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 561 accepted Meyer’s legal interpretation of τέλειος.</p></note> So I should not be surprised if he also has gone wrong over καλλοινήν.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn86" n="86"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The passage (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 1 90</ref>.5–7) was read as ὡς ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ π̣ε|ρὶ τοῦ γόμου τοῦ οἴνο̣υ, ἐ̣κλί|σθη καλῶς καὶ τὴν καλλοιν̣[ὴν   ̣  ̣  ̣  ̣] καὶ ἐ̣σφράγισα. The <ref target="http://resolver.sub.uni-hamburg.de/goobi/HANSh817">online image</ref> shows that καλλοι is possible, but there is no word beginning καλλοιν- ; the upright could also belong to nu. After that, there are traces of two letters; καλλον̣ή̣ν̣ is conceivable, but it is difficult to account for the accusative in the sequence.

            <p xml:id="p3431" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If the Petrie papyrus DXX (= <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7650">P.Petr.

The word in l. 4 which I read with some hesitation as στομ̣ωτ̣ήν would probably give a clue to the meaning if correctly deciphered. If στομωτήν is right, the object of χορηγεῖν would naturally be σκαφεῖα. Enclosed is a very provisional attempt at a restoration.</p>

            <p xml:id="p3457" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking up the passages in which ἐνοχλεῖσθαι is used of animals, I came across a curious phrase in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7495">P.Petrie II, no. 25 (a)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον ἐνοχλούμενον ἐγλοηθέν  θατα. In P.Petrie III Smyly quotes Mayser to the effect that ἐγλοηθέντα = ἐγλογηθέντα, ‘ausgeschieden’. The phrase recurs in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7496">P.P. II, no. 25 (b)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον \ἐνοχλούμενον/ ἐγλοηθέντα καὶ φλεβοτομηθέντα, but in the facsimile it seems to me that the word is clearly ἐγλουσθέντα, ‘after having received a drench and been bled.’ If you have time one day, could you verify on the originals (B.M. DLIX–X<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn96" n="96"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The actual inventory numbers are DLVIII–DLIX (558–559).</p></note>) whether my reading is right.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn97" n="97"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell pencilled, ‘probably’. Mayser’s interpretation, quoted in P.Petr. 3 61b, had also been questioned by Wilcken, who suggested that ἐγλοηθέντα stands for ἐκλουθέντα (Wilcken 1906: 519 = BL 1.360).</p></note> Mayser’s explanation strikes me as very far-fetched.</p>

            <p xml:id="p3462" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind giving me an impartial opinion on the following point?</p>
            <p xml:id="p3463" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>. The latter course would be simpler and would improve the make-up of the book. The former course would necessitate the transference of the note from the preliminary matter \(in which it is out of scale)/ to a place between the Introduction and the Texts. But is the information which it gives about the form of a typical Ptolemaic letter of sufficient interest to justify a departure from the ordinary arrangement? Or do you think that to any likely reader the information is superfluous? ||</p>
            <p xml:id="p3464" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I am in doubt myself and should in any case attach more weight to your opinion than to my own in a question of this sort.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn98" n="98"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar ultimately opted for the ‘former course’; see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, pp. 58–60 (‘The form of the papyri and the method of publication’).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p3469" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I observed lately that <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.Cairo</seg> 59415 and <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.S.I.</seg> 376 make up a nearly complete letter from Deinon dated L λϛ Υπερβερε ιζ. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn99" n="99"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The join was noted in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95113">P.Cair.Zen. 4</ref>, p. 289.

            <p xml:id="p3492" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind verifying a reading in the letter which you published in Archiv VI, p.102?<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn110" n="110"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell 1913: 102. The ‘letter’ corresponds to <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/10732">P.Fam.Tebt. 15</ref>.110–130.</p></note> The difficulty is the τοῦ in l. 9. Is it quite clear or would it be possible to read τὸ δ’? If τοῦ is certain Hunt suggests ἐπιλ[έξαντος in l. 8, which would do equally well and  obviate the necessity of supposing τοῦ to be a mistake of the scribe for καί.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn111" n="111"><p style="text-align: justify; "> ἐπιλ[έξαντος was printed in Sel.

            <p xml:id="p3495" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Bell,</p>
            <p xml:id="p3496" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the off print of your reviews. Hasn’t Boak misunderstood the construction of ll. 9-10 of the edict? It would give better grammar to read [ὧν] in l. 9<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn112" n="112"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34390">Boak 1934</ref>: 1–8, reedited as <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/17375">P.Cair.Isid. 1</ref>, where the passage runs ἀπὸ τοῦ προτεθέντος θείου διατάγματος | καὶ τοῦ αὐτῷ συννηννωμένου βρεουίου [οἷς] τὰ ἀντίγραφα τούτου μου τοῦ διατάγματος | δημοσίᾳ προύταξα, ἔνεστιν κτλ. (ll. 8–10). Edgar’s proposed emendation, [ὧν] instead of [καί], is recorded in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> 21 (1935) 89, and was also suggested by Wilcken, but the new edition preferred Collomp’s [οἷς].</p></note> and προύταξα, ἔνεστιν πᾶσι εὖ νο[εῖ]  ν in l. 10.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn113" n="113"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/17375">P.Cair.Isid. 1</ref>.10 n. records εὖ νο[εῖ]ν as a suggestiom by Lewis.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p3497" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The other day Mrs. Hunt<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn114" n="114"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Lucy Ellen Hunt, <seg style="font-style: italic;">née</seg> Bradshaw (1880–1959), widow of A. S. Hunt.</p></note> brought over a file of material for Tebt. III 2, which I have only partly looked through. Grenfell seems to have transcribed almost everything<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn115" n="115"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Grenfell’s input is mentioned in the preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3137">P.Tebt. III.1</ref>, but not exactly in these terms. It would be fair to say that without Grenfell’s transcriptions there would have been no P.Tebt. III.1–2.</p></note> and a great deal of work has been done by Hunt and Smyly also. A fair amount of commentary has already been written. Besides this material there || is a large packet of papyri which rather embarrasses me. I doubt whether it would be better to bring it all to the B.M. and take out what I need from time to time or to work through it here and deposit it with you in instalments. Probably the latter method would be better as some of the material is very fragile and might be injured by being carried backwards and forwards.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn116" n="116"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3740">P.Tebt. III.2</ref> reports that ‘Early in 1935 the papyri were removed from Oxford and temporarily stored in the British Museum’.</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p3506" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Bell,</p>
            <p xml:id="p3507" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking through some of the Hamburg papyri I came upon a reference to <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/36938">P. Lond.

            <p xml:id="p3513" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If the Petrie papyrus DXX (= <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7650">P.Petr.

            <p xml:id="p3539" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking up the passages in which ἐνοχλεῖσθαι is used of animals, I came across a curious phrase in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7495">P.Petrie II, no. 25 (a)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον ἐνοχλούμενον ἐγλοηθέν  θατα.

II, no. 25 (b)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον \ἐνοχλούμενον/ ἐγλοηθέντα καὶ φλεβοτομηθέντα, but in the facsimile it seems to me that the word is clearly ἐγλουσθέντα, ‘after having received a drench and been bled.’ If you have time one day, could you verify on the originals (B.M.

            <p xml:id="p3544" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind giving me an impartial opinion on the following point?</p>
            <p xml:id="p3545" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>. The latter course would be simpler and would improve the make-up of the book. The former course would necessitate the transference of the note from the preliminary matter \(in which it is out of scale)/ to a place between the Introduction and the Texts. But is the information which it gives about the form of a typical Ptolemaic letter of sufficient interest to justify a departure from the ordinary arrangement? Or do you think that to any likely reader the information is superfluous? ||</p>
            <p xml:id="p3546" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I am in doubt myself and should in any case attach more weight to your opinion than to my own in a question of this sort.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn98" n="98"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar ultimately opted for the ‘former course’; see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, pp. 58–60 (‘The form of the papyri and the method of publication’).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p3574" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind verifying a reading in the letter which you published in Archiv VI, p.102?<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn110" n="110"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell 1913: 102.

Is it quite clear or would it be possible to read τὸ δ’? If τοῦ is certain Hunt suggests ἐπιλ[έξαντος in l. 8, which would do equally well and  obviate the necessity of supposing τοῦ to be a mistake of the scribe for καί.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn111" n="111"><p style="text-align: justify; "> ἐπιλ[έξαντος was printed in Sel.

            <p xml:id="p3578" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the off print of your reviews. Hasn’t Boak misunderstood the construction of ll. 9-10 of the edict? It would give better grammar to read [ὧν] in l. 9<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn112" n="112"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34390">Boak 1934</ref>: 1–8, reedited as <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/17375">P.Cair.Isid. 1</ref>, where the passage runs ἀπὸ τοῦ προτεθέντος θείου διατάγματος | καὶ τοῦ αὐτῷ συννηννωμένου βρεουίου [οἷς] τὰ ἀντίγραφα τούτου μου τοῦ διατάγματος | δημοσίᾳ προύταξα, ἔνεστιν κτλ.

Edgar’s proposed emendation, [ὧν] instead of [καί], is recorded in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> 21 (1935) 89, and was also suggested by Wilcken, but the new edition preferred Collomp’s [οἷς].</p></note> and προύταξα, ἔνεστιν πᾶσι εὖ νο[εῖ]  ν in l. 10.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn113" n="113"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/17375">P.Cair.Isid. 1</ref>.10 n. records εὖ νο[εῖ]ν as a suggestiom by Lewis.</p></note></p>

Grenfell seems to have transcribed almost everything<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn115" n="115"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Grenfell’s input is mentioned in the preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3137">P.Tebt. III.1</ref>, but not exactly in these terms. It would be fair to say that without Grenfell’s transcriptions there would have been no P.Tebt. III.1–2.</p></note> and a great deal of work has been done by Hunt and Smyly also. A fair amount of commentary has already been written. Besides this material there || is a large packet of papyri which rather embarrasses me. I doubt whether it would be better to bring it all to the B.M. and take out what I need from time to time or to work through it here and deposit it with you in instalments. Probably the latter method would be better as some of the material is very fragile and might be injured by being carried backwards and forwards.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn116" n="116"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3740">P.Tebt.

            <p xml:id="p3582" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Bell,</p>
            <p xml:id="p3583" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking through some of the Hamburg papyri I came upon a reference to <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/36938">P. Lond.

            <p xml:id="p3589" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If the Petrie papyrus DXX (= <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7650">P.Petr.

            <p xml:id="p3615" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking up the passages in which ἐνοχλεῖσθαι is used of animals, I came across a curious phrase in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7495">P.Petrie II, no. 25 (a)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον ἐνοχλούμενον ἐγλοηθέν  θατα.

II, no. 25 (b)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον \ἐνοχλούμενον/ ἐγλοηθέντα καὶ φλεβοτομηθέντα, but in the facsimile it seems to me that the word is clearly ἐγλουσθέντα, ‘after having received a drench and been bled.’ If you have time one day, could you verify on the originals (B.M.

            <p xml:id="p3620" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind giving me an impartial opinion on the following point?</p>
            <p xml:id="p3621" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>. The latter course would be simpler and would improve the make-up of the book. The former course would necessitate the transference of the note from the preliminary matter \(in which it is out of scale)/ to a place between the Introduction and the Texts. But is the information which it gives about the form of a typical Ptolemaic letter of sufficient interest to justify a departure from the ordinary arrangement? Or do you think that to any likely reader the information is superfluous? ||</p>
            <p xml:id="p3622" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I am in doubt myself and should in any case attach more weight to your opinion than to my own in a question of this sort.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn98" n="98"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar ultimately opted for the ‘former course’; see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, pp. 58–60 (‘The form of the papyri and the method of publication’).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p3654" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the off print of your reviews. Hasn’t Boak misunderstood the construction of ll. 9-10 of the edict? It would give better grammar to read [ὧν] in l. 9<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn112" n="112"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34390">Boak 1934</ref>: 1–8, reedited as <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/17375">P.Cair.Isid. 1</ref>, where the passage runs ἀπὸ τοῦ προτεθέντος θείου διατάγματος | καὶ τοῦ αὐτῷ συννηννωμένου βρεουίου [οἷς] τὰ ἀντίγραφα τούτου μου τοῦ διατάγματος | δημοσίᾳ προύταξα, ἔνεστιν κτλ.

Edgar’s proposed emendation, [ὧν] instead of [καί], is recorded in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> 21 (1935) 89, and was also suggested by Wilcken, but the new edition preferred Collomp’s [οἷς].</p></note> and προύταξα, ἔνεστιν πᾶσι εὖ νο[εῖ]  ν in l. 10.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn113" n="113"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/17375">P.Cair.Isid. 1</ref>.10 n. records εὖ νο[εῖ]ν as a suggestiom by Lewis.</p></note></p>

Grenfell seems to have transcribed almost everything<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn115" n="115"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Grenfell’s input is mentioned in the preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3137">P.Tebt.

III.1–2.</p></note> and a great deal of work has been done by Hunt and Smyly also. A fair amount of commentary has already been written. Besides this material there || is a large packet of papyri which rather embarrasses me. I doubt whether it would be better to bring it all to the B.M. and take out what I need from time to time or to work through it here and deposit it with you in instalments. Probably the latter method would be better as some of the material is very fragile and might be injured by being carried backwards and forwards.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn116" n="116"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3740">P.Tebt.

            <p xml:id="p3660" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If the Petrie papyrus DXX (= <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7650">P.Petr.

The word in l. 4 which I read with some hesitation as στομ̣ωτ̣ήν would probably give a clue to the meaning if correctly deciphered. If στομωτήν is right, the object of χορηγεῖν would naturally be σκαφεῖα. Enclosed is a very provisional attempt at a restoration.</p>

            <p xml:id="p3686" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking up the passages in which ἐνοχλεῖσθαι is used of animals, I came across a curious phrase in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7495">P.Petrie II, no. 25 (a)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον ἐνοχλούμενον ἐγλοηθέν  θατα. In P.Petrie III Smyly quotes Mayser to the effect that ἐγλοηθέντα = ἐγλογηθέντα, ‘ausgeschieden’. The phrase recurs in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7496">P.P. II, no. 25 (b)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον \ἐνοχλούμενον/ ἐγλοηθέντα καὶ φλεβοτομηθέντα, but in the facsimile it seems to me that the word is clearly ἐγλουσθέντα, ‘after having received a drench and been bled.’ If you have time one day, could you verify on the originals (B.M. DLIX–X<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn96" n="96"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The actual inventory numbers are DLVIII–DLIX (558–559).</p></note>) whether my reading is right.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn97" n="97"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell pencilled, ‘probably’. Mayser’s interpretation, quoted in P.Petr. 3 61b, had also been questioned by Wilcken, who suggested that ἐγλοηθέντα stands for ἐκλουθέντα (Wilcken 1906: 519 = BL 1.360).</p></note> Mayser’s explanation strikes me as very far-fetched.</p>

            <p xml:id="p3691" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind giving me an impartial opinion on the following point?</p>
            <p xml:id="p3692" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>. The latter course would be simpler and would improve the make-up of the book. The former course would necessitate the transference of the note from the preliminary matter \(in which it is out of scale)/ to a place between the Introduction and the Texts. But is the information which it gives about the form of a typical Ptolemaic letter of sufficient interest to justify a departure from the ordinary arrangement? Or do you think that to any likely reader the information is superfluous? ||</p>
            <p xml:id="p3693" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I am in doubt myself and should in any case attach more weight to your opinion than to my own in a question of this sort.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn98" n="98"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar ultimately opted for the ‘former course’; see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, pp. 58–60 (‘The form of the papyri and the method of publication’).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p3697" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the trouble you have taken about my proofs. It is satisfactory in a negative way to know that none of your fragments can be fitted on.</p>
            <p xml:id="p3698" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I observed lately that <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.Cairo</seg> 59415 and <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.S.I.</seg> 376 make up a nearly complete letter from Deinon dated L λϛ Υπερβερε ιζ. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn99" n="99"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The join was noted in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95113">P.Cair.Zen. 4</ref>, p. 289.

L. 8 does not trouble me for it might be restored somewhat like this ὅτι γὰρ π[οιήσομεν δεῖ σε] νοεῖν.

            <p xml:id="p3739" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking up the passages in which ἐνοχλεῖσθαι is used of animals, I came across a curious phrase in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7495">P.Petrie II, no. 25 (a)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον ἐνοχλούμενον ἐγλοηθέν  θατα. In P.Petrie III Smyly quotes Mayser to the effect that ἐγλοηθέντα = ἐγλογηθέντα, ‘ausgeschieden’. The phrase recurs in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7496">P.P. II, no. 25 (b)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον \ἐνοχλούμενον/ ἐγλοηθέντα καὶ φλεβοτομηθέντα, but in the facsimile it seems to me that the word is clearly ἐγλουσθέντα, ‘after having received a drench and been bled.’ If you have time one day, could you verify on the originals (B.M. DLIX–X<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn96" n="96"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The actual inventory numbers are DLVIII–DLIX (558–559).</p></note>) whether my reading is right.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn97" n="97"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell pencilled, ‘probably’. Mayser’s interpretation, quoted in P.Petr. 3 61b, had also been questioned by Wilcken, who suggested that ἐγλοηθέντα stands for ἐκλουθέντα (Wilcken 1906: 519 = BL 1.360).</p></note> Mayser’s explanation strikes me as very far-fetched.</p>

            <p xml:id="p3744" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind giving me an impartial opinion on the following point?</p>
            <p xml:id="p3745" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>. The latter course would be simpler and would improve the make-up of the book. The former course would necessitate the transference of the note from the preliminary matter \(in which it is out of scale)/ to a place between the Introduction and the Texts. But is the information which it gives about the form of a typical Ptolemaic letter of sufficient interest to justify a departure from the ordinary arrangement? Or do you think that to any likely reader the information is superfluous? ||</p>
            <p xml:id="p3746" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I am in doubt myself and should in any case attach more weight to your opinion than to my own in a question of this sort.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn98" n="98"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar ultimately opted for the ‘former course’; see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, pp. 58–60 (‘The form of the papyri and the method of publication’).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p3750" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the trouble you have taken about my proofs. It is satisfactory in a negative way to know that none of your fragments can be fitted on.</p>
            <p xml:id="p3751" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I observed lately that <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.Cairo</seg> 59415 and <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.S.I.</seg> 376 make up a nearly complete letter from Deinon dated L λϛ Υπερβερε ιζ. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn99" n="99"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The join was noted in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95113">P.Cair.Zen. 4</ref>, p. 289. The two fragments were published together in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1477">P.Cair.Zen. 5 59853</ref>.</p></note> That suggested to me that the Manchester fragment might be part of B. M. 2678, and your transcript rather confirms my suspicion.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn100" n="100"><p style="text-align: justify; "> First published in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34820">Edgar 1934</ref>: 124–125 (no. 12), and then as <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2421">P.Ryl. 4 565</ref>.</p></note> Both fragments have the same number of lines, and in several cases they fit together admirably. L. 8 does not trouble me for it might be restored somewhat like this ὅτι γὰρ π[οιήσομεν δεῖ σε] νοεῖν. The only difficulty is in l. 4, where εἰ δὴ μέν   ought to be εἰδῶμεν and Grenfell’s ]εαιει is not quite intelligible. But his copies were made very rapidly and need to be || revised.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn101" n="101"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34820">Edgar 1934</ref>: 111.</p></note> ἀναλαμβάνων in l. 5 must mean ‘recover’ and the next line ‘and see that you grow strong again’; apparently Zenon had had an illness.</p>
            <p xml:id="p3752" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I should much like to see the re-discovered Petrie papyri and hope to have an opportunity some day soon.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn102" n="102"><p style="text-align: justify; "> It is unclear what these papyri were. One possibility is Petrie’s Ptolemaic cartonnage now kept at University College London; cf. P.Pintaudi 17 (esp. p. 78 and n. 10).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p3756" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Thanks for the hand copy, which accords with Grenfell’s note ‘fine large hand’. I feel little doubt about the identification. ειδημεν is not a mistake for ειδωμεν or ειδησωμεν, but the pluperfect (for the form see P.S.I 445,15).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn103" n="103"><p style="text-align: justify; "> PSI 4 445 was republished in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1274">P.Cair.Zen. 4 59643</ref>.

Cairo Zen. 59643, 15) and is not to be corrected to εἰδή&lt;σω&gt;μεν or εἰδ&lt;εί&gt;ημεν. The construction is a rarity in texts of this kind, but Deinon writes a rather superior style.’</p></note> Used quite correctly after εδει ... γραψαι.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn104" n="104"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Cf. Kühner–Gerth, <seg style="font-style: italic;">Grammatik</seg> ii 553 §7 (we owe the reference to D.

            <p xml:id="p3761" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Hunt has promised to do a volume (or two) of selections from the papyri for the Loeb series, but as he finds it a burden on his other work I have undertaken to do the transcriptions, translations etc, leaving the general selection to him. I feel ill qualified for the task and not very keen about it, but it is evidently desirable that he should be free to get on with his proper work; there || is no one living so good all round as he is. The little that I have done as yet makes me feel that there is a good deal to be done in the verification of readings even in well-known texts, and I should like some time to revise some of those in the B.M.</p>

Besides this material there || is a large packet of papyri which rather embarrasses me. I doubt whether it would be better to bring it all to the B.M. and take out what I need from time to time or to work through it here and deposit it with you in instalments.

            <p xml:id="p3786" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Bell,</p>
            <p xml:id="p3787" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking up the passages in which ἐνοχλεῖσθαι is used of animals, I came across a curious phrase in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7495">P.Petrie II, no. 25 (a)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον ἐνοχλούμενον ἐγλοηθέν  θατα. In P.Petrie III Smyly quotes Mayser to the effect that ἐγλοηθέντα = ἐγλογηθέντα, ‘ausgeschieden’. The phrase recurs in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7496">P.P. II, no. 25 (b)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον \ἐνοχλούμενον/ ἐγλοηθέντα καὶ φλεβοτομηθέντα, but in the facsimile it seems to me that the word is clearly ἐγλουσθέντα, ‘after having received a drench and been bled.’ If you have time one day, could you verify on the originals (B.M. DLIX–X<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn96" n="96"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The actual inventory numbers are DLVIII–DLIX (558–559).</p></note>) whether my reading is right.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn97" n="97"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell pencilled, ‘probably’. Mayser’s interpretation, quoted in P.Petr. 3 61b, had also been questioned by Wilcken, who suggested that ἐγλοηθέντα stands for ἐκλουθέντα (Wilcken 1906: 519 = BL 1.360).</p></note> Mayser’s explanation strikes me as very far-fetched.</p>
            <p xml:id="p3788" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I hope you found the three off-prints on your table. Many thanks for the loan. </p>

            <p xml:id="p3791" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Bell,</p>
            <p xml:id="p3792" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind giving me an impartial opinion on the following point?</p>
            <p xml:id="p3793" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>. The latter course would be simpler and would improve the make-up of the book. The former course would necessitate the transference of the note from the preliminary matter \(in which it is out of scale)/ to a place between the Introduction and the Texts. But is the information which it gives about the form of a typical Ptolemaic letter of sufficient interest to justify a departure from the ordinary arrangement? Or do you think that to any likely reader the information is superfluous? ||</p>
            <p xml:id="p3794" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I am in doubt myself and should in any case attach more weight to your opinion than to my own in a question of this sort.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn98" n="98"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar ultimately opted for the ‘former course’; see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, pp. 58–60 (‘The form of the papyri and the method of publication’).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p3798" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the trouble you have taken about my proofs. It is satisfactory in a negative way to know that none of your fragments can be fitted on.</p>
            <p xml:id="p3799" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I observed lately that <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.Cairo</seg> 59415 and <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.S.I.</seg> 376 make up a nearly complete letter from Deinon dated L λϛ Υπερβερε ιζ. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn99" n="99"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The join was noted in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95113">P.Cair.Zen. 4</ref>, p. 289. The two fragments were published together in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1477">P.Cair.Zen. 5 59853</ref>.</p></note> That suggested to me that the Manchester fragment might be part of B. M. 2678, and your transcript rather confirms my suspicion.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn100" n="100"><p style="text-align: justify; "> First published in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34820">Edgar 1934</ref>: 124–125 (no. 12), and then as <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2421">P.Ryl. 4 565</ref>.</p></note> Both fragments have the same number of lines, and in several cases they fit together admirably. L. 8 does not trouble me for it might be restored somewhat like this ὅτι γὰρ π[οιήσομεν δεῖ σε] νοεῖν. The only difficulty is in l. 4, where εἰ δὴ μέν   ought to be εἰδῶμεν and Grenfell’s ]εαιει is not quite intelligible.

            <p xml:id="p3800" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I should much like to see the re-discovered Petrie papyri and hope to have an opportunity some day soon.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn102" n="102"><p style="text-align: justify; "> It is unclear what these papyri were.

            <p xml:id="p3804" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Thanks for the hand copy, which accords with Grenfell’s note ‘fine large hand’. I feel little doubt about the identification. ειδημεν is not a mistake for ειδωμεν or ειδησωμεν, but the pluperfect (for the form see P.S.I 445,15).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn103" n="103"><p style="text-align: justify; "> PSI 4 445 was republished in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1274">P.Cair.Zen. 4 59643</ref>.

            <p xml:id="p3809" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Hunt has promised to do a volume (or two) of selections from the papyri for the Loeb series, but as he finds it a burden on his other work I have undertaken to do the transcriptions, translations etc, leaving the general selection to him. I feel ill qualified for the task and not very keen about it, but it is evidently desirable that he should be free to get on with his proper work; there || is no one living so good all round as he is. The little that I have done as yet makes me feel that there is a good deal to be done in the verification of readings even in well-known texts, and I should like some time to revise some of those in the B.M.</p>

I doubt whether it would be better to bring it all to the B.M. and take out what I need from time to time or to work through it here and deposit it with you in instalments. Probably the latter method would be better as some of the material is very fragile and might be injured by being carried backwards and forwards.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn116" n="116"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3740">P.Tebt.

            <p xml:id="p3830" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Bell,</p>
            <p xml:id="p3831" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking up the passages in which ἐνοχλεῖσθαι is used of animals, I came across a curious phrase in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7495">P.Petrie II, no. 25 (a)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον ἐνοχλούμενον ἐγλοηθέν  θατα. In P.Petrie III Smyly quotes Mayser to the effect that ἐγλοηθέντα = ἐγλογηθέντα, ‘ausgeschieden’. The phrase recurs in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7496">P.P. II, no. 25 (b)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον \ἐνοχλούμενον/ ἐγλοηθέντα καὶ φλεβοτομηθέντα, but in the facsimile it seems to me that the word is clearly ἐγλουσθέντα, ‘after having received a drench and been bled.’ If you have time one day, could you verify on the originals (B.M. DLIX–X<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn96" n="96"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The actual inventory numbers are DLVIII–DLIX (558–559).</p></note>) whether my reading is right.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn97" n="97"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell pencilled, ‘probably’. Mayser’s interpretation, quoted in P.Petr. 3 61b, had also been questioned by Wilcken, who suggested that ἐγλοηθέντα stands for ἐκλουθέντα (Wilcken 1906: 519 = BL 1.360).</p></note> Mayser’s explanation strikes me as very far-fetched.</p>
            <p xml:id="p3832" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I hope you found the three off-prints on your table. Many thanks for the loan. </p>

            <p xml:id="p3835" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Bell,</p>
            <p xml:id="p3836" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind giving me an impartial opinion on the following point?</p>
            <p xml:id="p3837" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>. The latter course would be simpler and would improve the make-up of the book. The former course would necessitate the transference of the note from the preliminary matter \(in which it is out of scale)/ to a place between the Introduction and the Texts. But is the information which it gives about the form of a typical Ptolemaic letter of sufficient interest to justify a departure from the ordinary arrangement? Or do you think that to any likely reader the information is superfluous? ||</p>
            <p xml:id="p3838" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I am in doubt myself and should in any case attach more weight to your opinion than to my own in a question of this sort.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn98" n="98"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar ultimately opted for the ‘former course’; see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, pp. 58–60 (‘The form of the papyri and the method of publication’).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p3841" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Bell,</p>
            <p xml:id="p3842" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the trouble you have taken about my proofs. It is satisfactory in a negative way to know that none of your fragments can be fitted on.</p>
            <p xml:id="p3843" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I observed lately that <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.Cairo</seg> 59415 and <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.S.I.</seg> 376 make up a nearly complete letter from Deinon dated L λϛ Υπερβερε ιζ. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn99" n="99"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The join was noted in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95113">P.Cair.Zen. 4</ref>, p. 289. The two fragments were published together in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1477">P.Cair.Zen. 5 59853</ref>.</p></note> That suggested to me that the Manchester fragment might be part of B. M. 2678, and your transcript rather confirms my suspicion.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn100" n="100"><p style="text-align: justify; "> First published in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34820">Edgar 1934</ref>: 124–125 (no. 12), and then as <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2421">P.Ryl. 4 565</ref>.</p></note> Both fragments have the same number of lines, and in several cases they fit together admirably. L. 8 does not trouble me for it might be restored somewhat like this ὅτι γὰρ π[οιήσομεν δεῖ σε] νοεῖν. The only difficulty is in l. 4, where εἰ δὴ μέν   ought to be εἰδῶμεν and Grenfell’s ]εαιει is not quite intelligible. But his copies were made very rapidly and need to be || revised.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn101" n="101"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34820">Edgar 1934</ref>: 111.</p></note> ἀναλαμβάνων in l. 5 must mean ‘recover’ and the next line ‘and see that you grow strong again’; apparently Zenon had had an illness.</p>
            <p xml:id="p3844" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I should much like to see the re-discovered Petrie papyri and hope to have an opportunity some day soon.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn102" n="102"><p style="text-align: justify; "> It is unclear what these papyri were. One possibility is Petrie’s Ptolemaic cartonnage now kept at University College London; cf. P.Pintaudi 17 (esp. p. 78 and n. 10).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p3848" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Thanks for the hand copy, which accords with Grenfell’s note ‘fine large hand’. I feel little doubt about the identification. ειδημεν is not a mistake for ειδωμεν or ειδησωμεν, but the pluperfect (for the form see P.S.I 445,15).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn103" n="103"><p style="text-align: justify; "> PSI 4 445 was republished in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1274">P.Cair.Zen. 4 59643</ref>.

            <p xml:id="p3853" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Hunt has promised to do a volume (or two) of selections from the papyri for the Loeb series, but as he finds it a burden on his other work I have undertaken to do the transcriptions, translations etc, leaving the general selection to him. I feel ill qualified for the task and not very keen about it, but it is evidently desirable that he should be free to get on with his proper work; there || is no one living so good all round as he is. The little that I have done as yet makes me feel that there is a good deal to be done in the verification of readings even in well-known texts, and I should like some time to revise some of those in the B.M.</p>

            <p xml:id="p3870" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the off print of your reviews. Hasn’t Boak misunderstood the construction of ll. 9-10 of the edict? It would give better grammar to read [ὧν] in l. 9<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn112" n="112"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34390">Boak 1934</ref>: 1–8, reedited as <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/17375">P.Cair.Isid. 1</ref>, where the passage runs ἀπὸ τοῦ προτεθέντος θείου διατάγματος | καὶ τοῦ αὐτῷ συννηννωμένου βρεουίου [οἷς] τὰ ἀντίγραφα τούτου μου τοῦ διατάγματος | δημοσίᾳ προύταξα, ἔνεστιν κτλ.

Grenfell seems to have transcribed almost everything<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn115" n="115"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Grenfell’s input is mentioned in the preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3137">P.Tebt.

III.1–2.</p></note> and a great deal of work has been done by Hunt and Smyly also. A fair amount of commentary has already been written. Besides this material there || is a large packet of papyri which rather embarrasses me. I doubt whether it would be better to bring it all to the B.M. and take out what I need from time to time or to work through it here and deposit it with you in instalments. Probably the latter method would be better as some of the material is very fragile and might be injured by being carried backwards and forwards.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn116" n="116"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3740">P.Tebt.

            <p xml:id="p3874" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Bell,</p>
            <p xml:id="p3875" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind giving me an impartial opinion on the following point?</p>
            <p xml:id="p3876" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>. The latter course would be simpler and would improve the make-up of the book. The former course would necessitate the transference of the note from the preliminary matter \(in which it is out of scale)/ to a place between the Introduction and the Texts. But is the information which it gives about the form of a typical Ptolemaic letter of sufficient interest to justify a departure from the ordinary arrangement? Or do you think that to any likely reader the information is superfluous? ||</p>
            <p xml:id="p3877" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I am in doubt myself and should in any case attach more weight to your opinion than to my own in a question of this sort.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn98" n="98"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar ultimately opted for the ‘former course’; see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, pp. 58–60 (‘The form of the papyri and the method of publication’).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p3880" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Bell,</p>
            <p xml:id="p3881" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the trouble you have taken about my proofs. It is satisfactory in a negative way to know that none of your fragments can be fitted on.</p>
            <p xml:id="p3882" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I observed lately that <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.Cairo</seg> 59415 and <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.S.I.</seg> 376 make up a nearly complete letter from Deinon dated L λϛ Υπερβερε ιζ. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn99" n="99"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The join was noted in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95113">P.Cair.Zen. 4</ref>, p. 289. The two fragments were published together in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1477">P.Cair.Zen. 5 59853</ref>.</p></note> That suggested to me that the Manchester fragment might be part of B. M. 2678, and your transcript rather confirms my suspicion.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn100" n="100"><p style="text-align: justify; "> First published in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34820">Edgar 1934</ref>: 124–125 (no. 12), and then as <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2421">P.Ryl. 4 565</ref>.</p></note> Both fragments have the same number of lines, and in several cases they fit together admirably. L. 8 does not trouble me for it might be restored somewhat like this ὅτι γὰρ π[οιήσομεν δεῖ σε] νοεῖν. The only difficulty is in l. 4, where εἰ δὴ μέν   ought to be εἰδῶμεν and Grenfell’s ]εαιει is not quite intelligible. But his copies were made very rapidly and need to be || revised.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn101" n="101"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34820">Edgar 1934</ref>: 111.</p></note> ἀναλαμβάνων in l. 5 must mean ‘recover’ and the next line ‘and see that you grow strong again’; apparently Zenon had had an illness.</p>
            <p xml:id="p3883" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I should much like to see the re-discovered Petrie papyri and hope to have an opportunity some day soon.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn102" n="102"><p style="text-align: justify; "> It is unclear what these papyri were. One possibility is Petrie’s Ptolemaic cartonnage now kept at University College London; cf. P.Pintaudi 17 (esp. p. 78 and n. 10).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p3887" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Thanks for the hand copy, which accords with Grenfell’s note ‘fine large hand’. I feel little doubt about the identification. ειδημεν is not a mistake for ειδωμεν or ειδησωμεν, but the pluperfect (for the form see P.S.I 445,15).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn103" n="103"><p style="text-align: justify; "> PSI 4 445 was republished in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1274">P.Cair.Zen. 4 59643</ref>.

Cairo Zen. 59643, 15) and is not to be corrected to εἰδή&lt;σω&gt;μεν or εἰδ&lt;εί&gt;ημεν.

            <p xml:id="p3891" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind looking at <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2817">P. Hib. 84 (a)</ref> (= Lond.

There is an Ἀπόλλων in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/3216">P.Lille 9</ref>,2; but if you look at the plate, you will see that the right reading is παρὰ Πολέμωνος .<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn107" n="107"><p style="text-align: justify; "> [π]αρὰ Πολέμωνος has now been read by <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/86739">Clarysse 2013</ref>: 266 n. 11.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p3892" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Hunt has promised to do a volume (or two) of selections from the papyri for the Loeb series, but as he finds it a burden on his other work I have undertaken to do the transcriptions, translations etc, leaving the general selection to him. I feel ill qualified for the task and not very keen about it, but it is evidently desirable that he should be free to get on with his proper work; there || is no one living so good all round as he is. The little that I have done as yet makes me feel that there is a good deal to be done in the verification of readings even in well-known texts, and I should like some time to revise some of those in the B.M.</p>

            <p xml:id="p3913" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Bell,</p>
            <p xml:id="p3914" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the trouble you have taken about my proofs. It is satisfactory in a negative way to know that none of your fragments can be fitted on.</p>
            <p xml:id="p3915" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I observed lately that <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.Cairo</seg> 59415 and <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.S.I.</seg> 376 make up a nearly complete letter from Deinon dated L λϛ Υπερβερε ιζ. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn99" n="99"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The join was noted in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95113">P.Cair.Zen. 4</ref>, p. 289. The two fragments were published together in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1477">P.Cair.Zen. 5 59853</ref>.</p></note> That suggested to me that the Manchester fragment might be part of B. M. 2678, and your transcript rather confirms my suspicion.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn100" n="100"><p style="text-align: justify; "> First published in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34820">Edgar 1934</ref>: 124–125 (no. 12), and then as <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2421">P.Ryl. 4 565</ref>.</p></note> Both fragments have the same number of lines, and in several cases they fit together admirably. L. 8 does not trouble me for it might be restored somewhat like this ὅτι γὰρ π[οιήσομεν δεῖ σε] νοεῖν. The only difficulty is in l. 4, where εἰ δὴ μέν   ought to be εἰδῶμεν and Grenfell’s ]εαιει is not quite intelligible. But his copies were made very rapidly and need to be || revised.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn101" n="101"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34820">Edgar 1934</ref>: 111.</p></note> ἀναλαμβάνων in l. 5 must mean ‘recover’ and the next line ‘and see that you grow strong again’; apparently Zenon had had an illness.</p>
            <p xml:id="p3916" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I should much like to see the re-discovered Petrie papyri and hope to have an opportunity some day soon.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn102" n="102"><p style="text-align: justify; "> It is unclear what these papyri were. One possibility is Petrie’s Ptolemaic cartonnage now kept at University College London; cf. P.Pintaudi 17 (esp. p. 78 and n. 10).</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p3920" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Thanks for the hand copy, which accords with Grenfell’s note ‘fine large hand’. I feel little doubt about the identification. ειδημεν is not a mistake for ειδωμεν or ειδησωμεν, but the pluperfect (for the form see P.S.I 445,15).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn103" n="103"><p style="text-align: justify; "> PSI 4 445 was republished in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1274">P.Cair.Zen. 4 59643</ref>.

Cairo Zen. 59643, 15) and is not to be corrected to εἰδή&lt;σω&gt;μεν or εἰδ&lt;εί&gt;ημεν. The construction is a rarity in texts of this kind, but Deinon writes a rather superior style.’</p></note> Used quite correctly after εδει ... γραψαι.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn104" n="104"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Cf. Kühner–Gerth, <seg style="font-style: italic;">Grammatik</seg> ii 553 §7 (we owe the reference to D.

There is an Ἀπόλλων in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/3216">P.Lille 9</ref>,2; but if you look at the plate, you will see that the right reading is παρὰ Πολέμωνος .<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn107" n="107"><p style="text-align: justify; "> [π]αρὰ Πολέμωνος has now been read by <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/86739">Clarysse 2013</ref>: 266 n. 11.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p3925" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Hunt has promised to do a volume (or two) of selections from the papyri for the Loeb series, but as he finds it a burden on his other work I have undertaken to do the transcriptions, translations etc, leaving the general selection to him. I feel ill qualified for the task and not very keen about it, but it is evidently desirable that he should be free to get on with his proper work; there || is no one living so good all round as he is. The little that I have done as yet makes me feel that there is a good deal to be done in the verification of readings even in well-known texts, and I should like some time to revise some of those in the B.M.</p>

Besides this material there || is a large packet of papyri which rather embarrasses me. I doubt whether it would be better to bring it all to the B.M. and take out what I need from time to time or to work through it here and deposit it with you in instalments. Probably the latter method would be better as some of the material is very fragile and might be injured by being carried backwards and forwards.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn116" n="116"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3740">P.Tebt.

            <p xml:id="p3952" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Hunt has promised to do a volume (or two) of selections from the papyri for the Loeb series, but as he finds it a burden on his other work I have undertaken to do the transcriptions, translations etc, leaving the general selection to him. I feel ill qualified for the task and not very keen about it, but it is evidently desirable that he should be free to get on with his proper work; there || is no one living so good all round as he is. The little that I have done as yet makes me feel that there is a good deal to be done in the verification of readings even in well-known texts, and I should like some time to revise some of those in the B.M.</p>

            <p xml:id="p3975" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Hunt has promised to do a volume (or two) of selections from the papyri for the Loeb series, but as he finds it a burden on his other work I have undertaken to do the transcriptions, translations etc, leaving the general selection to him. I feel ill qualified for the task and not very keen about it, but it is evidently desirable that he should be free to get on with his proper work; there || is no one living so good all round as he is. The little that I have done as yet makes me feel that there is a good deal to be done in the verification of readings even in well-known texts, and I should like some time to revise some of those in the B.M.</p>

            <p xml:id="p3992" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the off print of your reviews. Hasn’t Boak misunderstood the construction of ll. 9-10 of the edict?

Besides this material there || is a large packet of papyri which rather embarrasses me. I doubt whether it would be better to bring it all to the B.M. and take out what I need from time to time or to work through it here and deposit it with you in instalments. Probably the latter method would be better as some of the material is very fragile and might be injured by being carried backwards and forwards.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn116" n="116"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3740">P.Tebt.

Besides this material there || is a large packet of papyri which rather embarrasses me. I doubt whether it would be better to bring it all to the B.M. and take out what I need from time to time or to work through it here and deposit it with you in instalments. Probably the latter method would be better as some of the material is very fragile and might be injured by being carried backwards and forwards.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn116" n="116"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3740">P.Tebt.

If τοῦ is certain Hunt suggests ἐπιλ[έξαντος in l. 8, which would do equally well and  obviate the necessity of supposing τοῦ to be a mistake of the scribe for καί.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn111" n="111"><p style="text-align: justify; "> ἐπιλ[έξαντος was printed in Sel.

            <p xml:id="p4016" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Bell,</p>
            <p xml:id="p4017" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the off print of your reviews. Hasn’t Boak misunderstood the construction of ll. 9-10 of the edict? It would give better grammar to read [ὧν] in l. 9<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn112" n="112"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34390">Boak 1934</ref>: 1–8, reedited as <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/17375">P.Cair.Isid. 1</ref>, where the passage runs ἀπὸ τοῦ προτεθέντος θείου διατάγματος | καὶ τοῦ αὐτῷ συννηννωμένου βρεουίου [οἷς] τὰ ἀντίγραφα τούτου μου τοῦ διατάγματος | δημοσίᾳ προύταξα, ἔνεστιν κτλ. (ll. 8–10). Edgar’s proposed emendation, [ὧν] instead of [καί], is recorded in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> 21 (1935) 89, and was also suggested by Wilcken, but the new edition preferred Collomp’s [οἷς].</p></note> and προύταξα, ἔνεστιν πᾶσι εὖ νο[εῖ]  ν in l. 10.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn113" n="113"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/17375">P.Cair.Isid. 1</ref>.10 n. records εὖ νο[εῖ]ν as a suggestiom by Lewis.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p4018" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The other day Mrs. Hunt<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn114" n="114"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Lucy Ellen Hunt, <seg style="font-style: italic;">née</seg> Bradshaw (1880–1959), widow of A. S.

Grenfell seems to have transcribed almost everything<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn115" n="115"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Grenfell’s input is mentioned in the preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3137">P.Tebt. III.1</ref>, but not exactly in these terms. It would be fair to say that without Grenfell’s transcriptions there would have been no P.Tebt. III.1–2.</p></note> and a great deal of work has been done by Hunt and Smyly also. A fair amount of commentary has already been written. Besides this material there || is a large packet of papyri which rather embarrasses me. I doubt whether it would be better to bring it all to the B.M. and take out what I need from time to time or to work through it here and deposit it with you in instalments. Probably the latter method would be better as some of the material is very fragile and might be injured by being carried backwards and forwards.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn116" n="116"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3740">P.Tebt. III.2</ref> reports that ‘Early in 1935 the papyri were removed from Oxford and temporarily stored in the British Museum’.</p></note></p>

            <p xml:id="p4021" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Bell,</p>
            <p xml:id="p4022" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the off print of your reviews. Hasn’t Boak misunderstood the construction of ll. 9-10 of the edict? It would give better grammar to read [ὧν] in l. 9<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn112" n="112"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34390">Boak 1934</ref>: 1–8, reedited as <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/17375">P.Cair.Isid. 1</ref>, where the passage runs ἀπὸ τοῦ προτεθέντος θείου διατάγματος | καὶ τοῦ αὐτῷ συννηννωμένου βρεουίου [οἷς] τὰ ἀντίγραφα τούτου μου τοῦ διατάγματος | δημοσίᾳ προύταξα, ἔνεστιν κτλ. (ll. 8–10). Edgar’s proposed emendation, [ὧν] instead of [καί], is recorded in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> 21 (1935) 89, and was also suggested by Wilcken, but the new edition preferred Collomp’s [οἷς].</p></note> and προύταξα, ἔνεστιν πᾶσι εὖ νο[εῖ]  ν in l. 10.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn113" n="113"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/17375">P.Cair.Isid. 1</ref>.10 n. records εὖ νο[εῖ]ν as a suggestiom by Lewis.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p4023" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The other day Mrs. Hunt<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn114" n="114"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Lucy Ellen Hunt, <seg style="font-style: italic;">née</seg> Bradshaw (1880–1959), widow of A. S. Hunt.</p></note> brought over a file of material for Tebt. III 2, which I have only partly looked through. Grenfell seems to have transcribed almost everything<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn115" n="115"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Grenfell’s input is mentioned in the preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3137">P.Tebt. III.1</ref>, but not exactly in these terms. It would be fair to say that without Grenfell’s transcriptions there would have been no P.Tebt. III.1–2.</p></note> and a great deal of work has been done by Hunt and Smyly also. A fair amount of commentary has already been written. Besides this material there || is a large packet of papyri which rather embarrasses me. I doubt whether it would be better to bring it all to the B.M. and take out what I need from time to time or to work through it here and deposit it with you in instalments. Probably the latter method would be better as some of the material is very fragile and might be injured by being carried backwards and forwards.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn116" n="116"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3740">P.Tebt. III.2</ref> reports that ‘Early in 1935 the papyri were removed from Oxford and temporarily stored in the British Museum’.</p></note></p>
            <p xml:id="p4024" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Yours sincerely | C. C. Edgar</p>
