               <p xml:id="p1" style="text-align: left; ">It is easy to overlook David George Hogarth (1862–1927) in the history of papyrology. He is better known for his archaeological fieldwork, which included excavations in Egypt but which also ranged broadly across Greece, Turkey, and Syria.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1"><p style="text-align: left; "> For an overview of Hogarth’s career, see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/96066">Lock 1990</ref>; <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/96095">Hall 1928</ref>.</p></note> Museological circles know him as Arthur Evans’ successor as Keeper of the Ashmolean (1909–1927), a man whose travels and decades of excavations enriched its collections as well as those of other institutions such as the Pitt Rivers and British Museums.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2"><p style="text-align: left; "> Hogarth’s name appears in the entries for 170 items in the Ashmolean Museum, 81 in the online Pitt Rivers Museum catalogue (<ref target="http://databases.prm.ox.ac.uk/fmi/webd/objects_online">http://databases.prm.ox.ac.uk/fmi/webd/objects_online</ref>), and 1,793 in the British Museum (<ref target="https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/search?agent=Dr%2520David%2520George%2520Hogarth">https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/search?agent=Dr%20David%20George%20Hogarth</ref>). Both sites last accessed 15 August 2022.</p></note> In the popular imagination, moreover, he will be forever linked with the Arab Bureau and especially the activities of Thomas E. Lawrence (“Lawrence of Arabia”), whose career he supported generously.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3"><p style="text-align: left; "> In a 17 December 1927 letter to Dick Knowles, Lawrence wrote “Today is the anniversary of our sailing from Southampton. I was very unhappy at tearing up my roots, once more. The first time I left England, in 1905, was a dream of delight: not that it was the first time, of course; but in 1905 I began my own, independent, voluntary travels. France, mainly: then further afield, by slow degrees, until the War cut short that development of me into a sort of Hogarth: a travelled, archaeological sort of man, with geography and a pen as his two standbys. <seg style="font-weight: bold;">Hogarth was a very wonderful man. You never met him. He was first of all human, and then charitable, and then alive. I owed him everything I had, since I was 17, which is the age at which I suddenly found myself.</seg> You may have begun a little earlier, since the being torn out of home is an education in itself” (my emphasis). See <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/96083">Garnett 1941: no. 149, p. 255</ref>.</p></note> </p>
               <p xml:id="p2" style="text-align: left; ">By comparison, the brief period in which Hogarth was occupied by papyrology as an employee of the Egypt Exploration Fund (1893–6) appears but a footnote.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="4"><p style="text-align: left; "> The Egypt Exploration Fund is today known as the Egypt Exploration Society, but the renaming did not occur until 1919 and I will refer to it throughout this article in Hogarth’s fashion, as “the Fund.” Hogarth’s starting salary was £300 a year, plus expenses: Hogarth to Laura V. Uppleby, Harston Rectory, Grantham (undated): P452/PER/2/2/1. By the time of his resignation, it had evidently risen to £500: see B. P. Grenfell to W. M. F. Petrie, Beni-Mazar (14 February 1897), transcribed by <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/96090">Hickey and Keenan (2016: 365–375, on 373)</ref>. The latter letter is now kept in the Petrie Museum of Archaeology (6/GRE/01); the former is part of the Papers of David George Hogarth (1860s–2017), now held by the Magdalen College Archives, cited throughout this article in accordance with the Archive’s records (<ref target="https://archive-cat.magd.ox.ac.uk/records/P452">https://archive-cat.magd.ox.ac.uk/records/P452</ref>). Last accessed 15 August 2022.</p></note> For the Fund he participated in several excavations, but of papyrological interest was his single, pioneering season in the Fayum (1895/6) alongside Bernard P. Grenfell.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5" n="5"><p style="text-align: left; "> Arthur S. Hunt did not arrive in the Fayum until 16 January 1896 and worked that season at his own expense. For a summary of the season’s work, see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/15202">Davoli (1998: 74–76)</ref>.</p></note> This dig was unconventional in its time for targeting Graeco-Roman towns instead of Egyptian temples and tombs, and for its pursuit of a singular objective: as Hogarth wrote from the field, “all know it’s papyrus we want.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn6" n="6"><p style="text-align: left; "> Letter to Laura V. Hogarth, Kûm Washîm, Sennures, Fayûm (4 January 1896): P452/PER/2/2/2. On the unconventional nature of the dig, see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95143">Grenfell, Hunt, and Hogarth 1900</ref>: 20.</p></note> The idea for the expedition, according to a contemporary account, was Grenfell’s,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn7" n="7"><p style="text-align: left; "> “It was in 1877 that a large find of papyri was made in the Fayum, and later Professor Petrie made his discovery of papyri in mummy cases. Digging was not always done by organized diggers, and therefore one had to go to the dealers in order to obtain papyri. The system was bad, but a good deal could still be got from them. The idea of digging for papyri occurred to Mr. Grenfell, and accordingly he and the lecturer [sc. Hogarth], having obtained a concession, began work on two mounds in the Fayum.” “Egypt Exploration Fund,” The Times (3 July 1896). </p></note> but it was doubtless inspired by official excavations that Egyptian dealers conducted until 1898, under concession from the Antiquities Service. These too yielded papyri.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn8" n="8"><p style="text-align: left; "> See <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/84769">Hagen and Ryholt (2016: 122–124)</ref>, on dealers and the official permits they obtained.</p></note></p>
               <p xml:id="p3" style="text-align: left; ">The motivation to dig specifically for papyri was prompted by financial considerations – wouldn’t it be cheaper in the long run to excavate than to purchase? – but also by scholarly ones. Although one should not equate the techniques, goals, and records of nineteenth-century archaeology with those of sophisticated twenty-first century digs, there was a desire both to ascertain the provenance of the papyri being sought and to identify the ancient sites under excavation,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn9" n="9"><p style="text-align: left; "> “We are high up on the flank of a great mound, in which we are digging. Lord only knows what town it is – it’s one of our duties to find out the name – but anyway it is big enough to last us a full season and more. All Graeco-Roman, thank heavens! no hieroglyphs or hieratic postures or women with the heads hoisted off their shoulders! We are after papyri mainly and have got even now some which may turn out well. At present the dig is mainly in the Temple and the Tombs…” Hogarth to Charles R. Fletcher, Kûm Washîm, Sennures, Fayûm (30 December 1894): P452/PER/4/4. See also the second quotation in fn. 10 (supra) from <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/96072">Hogarth and Grenfell (1895–6: 14)</ref>. The two mounds of the 1895/6 season turned out to preserve the ruins of ancient Karanis and Bacchias.</p></note> knowledge that was inhibited by the uncertainties and unsavory aspects of the antiquities market.<anchor xml:id="Ref104883879"/><note place="foot" xml:id="ftn10" n="10"><p style="text-align: left; "> The financial and ethical concerns are evident in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/96074">Hunt (1926: 3)</ref>: “During the course of 1895 a project was shaped which was destined to have a far-reaching effect on the development of papyrology. The flow of papyri from various districts to the antiquity-dealers was obviously proceeding. Might it not be more satisfactory, perhaps in the long term more economical, to go to the source and dig them up for oneself instead of buying them at second or third hand, thereby encouraging an illicit traffic.” The link between scholarly and ethical concerns is implicit in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/96072">Hogarth and Grenfell (1895–6: 14)</ref>: “the Faiyûm at this moment is very far indeed from being worked out. Much as has been filtering from it to Europe through various channels since 1877, the dealers’ shops in Cairo and Medinet were still full of its papyri in 1895. <seg style="font-weight: bold;">And furthermore, concerning all the documents which have found their way to London, Berlin, Vienna, and Paris, hardly a single fact as to </seg><seg style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">provenance </seg><seg style="font-weight: bold;">is known, their discovery having been due in all cases to native diggers. Consequently, out of scores of place names, added by the papyri to the meagre literary list of towns in the Arsinoite nome, only one had been fixed to any particular site</seg>: that one was <seg style="font-style: italic;">Socnopaei Nesus</seg>, identified certainly with <seg style="font-style: italic;">Dimê<seg style="font-style: italic;">h </seg></seg>in the far north-west” (my emphasis).</p></note> The Fund’s joint appointment of Hogarth and Grenfell, whose expertise lay in field archaeology and papyrology, respectively, reflects the dig’s various imperatives. </p>
               <p xml:id="p4" style="text-align: left; ">Hogarth was the more experienced member of the team and brought an approach to fieldwork that was typical of his era’s methodology.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn11" n="11"><p style="text-align: left; "> See, e.g., the judicious remarks of <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/65966">Montserrat 1996: 133–137</ref>. Cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/96066">Lock 1990: 180–185</ref>.</p></note> He made plans of important structures under excavation and recorded in a daybook both his observations of the environment as well as the dig’s activities. As a consequence, of the papyrological volumes in the Fund’s Graeco-Roman Memoirs series, <seg style="font-style: italic;">Fayum Towns and their Papyri </seg>(= <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95143">P.Fay.</ref>) stands out for its attention to the villages’ archaeology.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn12" n="12"><p style="text-align: left; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95143">Grenfell, Hunt, and Hogarth 1900</ref>; see also the field report <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/96072">Hogarth and Grenfell 1895–6</ref>. Cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/96066">Lock 1990: 185</ref>: “It is very much a book for the papyrologist.”</p></note> But despite the excavation’s novel objectives and the added value of Hogarth’s expertise, several events quickly conspired to relegate him to papyrological obscurity. For one, he tendered his resignation to the Fund on 14 March 1896, following the conclusion of the season. He would never dig for papyri again personally, instead recommending that Grenfell be entrusted the work in the future.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn13" n="13"><p style="text-align: left; "> For Hogarth’s resignation letter, offering six months’ notice, see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/65966">Montserrat (1996: 167–171)</ref>: the letter is housed in the archives of the Egypt Exploration Society (EES Inv. III k 139). On the same day he wrote home “I have resigned the Fund so must get home to arrange matters and decide what’s to be done.” Hogarth to Laura V. Hogarth, Mena House Hotel, Pyramids, Cairo (14 March 1896): P452/PER/2/2/2. For the recommendation of Grenfell, see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/65966">Montserrat (1996: 139)</ref>, citing the minutes of the Fund’s Annual General Meeting on 13 November 1896. Grenfell’s professional capabilities more than made up for an occasionally difficult personality: Hogarth at one point writes that he was “very unkempt + jerky + sometimes combative – his mother again! But we get on all right – best when there is a lot to do.” Hogarth to Laura V. Hogarth, Kûm Washîm, Sennures, Fayûm (4 January 1896): P452/PER/2/2/2. </p></note> That advice was heeded; the initial Fayum season’s success justified not only further expeditions for papyri but also, in time, the Fund’s creation of a dedicated Graeco-Roman branch. The rest, as they say, is history: instead of a hoped-for second season in the Fayum,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn14" n="14"><p style="text-align: left; "> Hogarth and Grenfell surveyed the southern Fayum in the first week of March before departing Egypt, and then publicly advocated for the continuation of the Fayum expedition in the winter of 1896/7: see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/96072">Hogarth and Grenfell 1895–6: 19</ref>. But Grenfell and Hunt would not return to the Fayum until the 1898/9 season.</p></note> the very next winter Grenfell and Hunt hit upon a papyrological bonanza in the trash heaps of ancient Oxyrhynchus at Behnesa, to their everlasting fame. Hogarth may have dug for papyri with Grenfell before Hunt had even set foot in Egypt, but the Oxford Dioscuri’s pre-eminence meant that the phrase ‘Grenfell and ________’ would evermore be reflexively supplemented by ‘Hunt’ instead of ‘Hogarth.’ He became the forgotten man of the first Fayum season – the Michael Collins of the crew. That neither Grenfell nor Hunt applied his more archaeological approach to fieldwork in their future endeavors is an appropriate metaphor for papyrology’s memory of Hogarth more generally.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn15" n="15"><p style="text-align: left; "> As <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/76740">Rathbone (2007: 200)</ref> notes, Grenfell and Hunt “had little interest in the archaeology of the sites where they worked. They kept no systematic records and made no plans of their excavations, although Grenfell was preparing for publication an annotated map of the mounds of Oxyrhynchus which he never finished. However they were diligent in keeping the mummies, complete pots and objects of all types, from plough to haircomb, found incidentally by their workmen.” But in 1895/6, Grenfell did make records of his activities, to which Hogarth’s daybook (P452/ARC/3/3) refers on several occasions: “v. G’s notebook for Tombs” (27 December 1895); “v. Grenfell’s Diary” (annotation for 26 January – 12 February 1896, while Hogarth traveled upriver: see further, below); and “cf. B.P.G.” for each of Hogarth’s first days back in camp (12–14 February 1896).</p></note></p>

               <p xml:id="p5" style="text-align: left; ">In the early 1900s, following the publication of <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95143'">P.Fay.</ref>, the Fund distributed to institutional subscribers the papyri from its Fayum excavations, including those Grenfell and Hogarth had excavated in the 1895/6 season.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn16" n="16"><p style="text-align: left; "> A complete list of the current locations for papyri published in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95143">P.Fay.</ref> is available online: <ref target="http://www.papyrology.ox.ac.uk/POxy/lists/antlist.html">http://www.papyrology.ox.ac.uk/POxy/lists/antlist.html</ref>. Last accessed 15 August 2022.</p></note> But during his time in Egypt, Hogarth had also purchased papyri of his own, whose existence is not entirely news. Grenfell and Hunt’s preface to the second volume of <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95162">P.Grenf.</ref> (dated 10 October 1896), for example, is transparent in this regard:</p>

                  <lb/>Of the 146 papyri published in this volume nos. xv–xxxvii, lvii and lxxix were acquired by Mr. D. G. Hogarth and Mr. E. R.

               </quote>
               <p xml:id="p6" style="text-align: left; ">Other papyri evidently passed through Hogarth’s hands, as well. On 15 May 1935, years after he had passed away on 6 November 1927, his son William presented a collection of papyri to the Bodleian Library in Oxford, the ownership history of which Eefje P. Wegener duly noted when she published in short order a few of its items.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn18" n="18"><p style="text-align: left; "> See <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/36243">Wegener 1937: 211</ref>. Apart from Edgar Lobel, who was then Keeper in the Bodleian, Wegener was the first to study Hogarth’s papyri: she visited Oxford in August 1936, a little more than a year following the donation. Wegener records the date as 11 May, but since the library’s Register of donations states that the collection was accessioned on 15 May (see n. 66), I opt for the latter. On Lobel’s recording and cataloguing of the papyri added in 1935, see further, below.</p></note> As I will detail momentarily, these were certainly his father’s. Because little more is known about them, in what follows, I attempt to shed new light on their acquisition(s) and on Hogarth’s activities on the market, drawing upon previously unpublished archival material, including personal correspondence preserved both by his wife and by his friend Charles R. L. Fletcher.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn19" n="19"><p style="text-align: left; "> As was Hogarth (1881–1885), Fletcher was a demy at Magdalen (1876–1880), and subsequently a Tutor in Modern History (1885–1906) and Fellow of the college (1889–1906).</p></note> A catalogue of Hogarth’s acquisitions as they are currently understood appears as the conclusion (= Table 1).</p>
               <p xml:id="p7" style="text-align: left; ">Most of the Hogarth / Bevan papyri published in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95162">P.Grenf. 2</ref> are obviously related to one another.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn20" n="20"><p style="text-align: left; "> Two exceptions are <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/11360">P.Grenf. 2 57</ref> and <ref target="https://papyri.info/ddbdp/p.grenf;2;79coli">P.Grenf. 2 79</ref>, regarding which see further, below. Hogarth knew Edwyn (“Ned”) Bevan from the previous season’s dig at Alexandria (see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/96076">Hogarth and Benson 1894–5: 2</ref>). </p></note> Not only do they share a provenance (= Pathyris) and Ptolemaic date, but (more tellingly) many originate in the bilingual archive of Peteharsemtheus, son of Panebchounis.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn21" n="21"><p style="text-align: left; "> = <ref target="https://www.trismegistos.org/archive/183">TM Arch 183</ref>.

At some point in July 1896, Bevan donated his to the British Museum (where they were catalogued as Papyri 654–666), and on 25 July 1896 the museum purchased Hogarth’s and catalogued them as Papyri 667–681.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn22" n="22"><p style="text-align: left; "> See the BL’s Digitised Manuscripts portal (<ref target="http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Default.aspx">http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Default.aspx</ref>).

Hogarth, PostBoat “Amonarpas” (5 February 1896): P452/PER/2/2/2. <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/65966">Montserrat (1996: 156)</ref> is mistaken when he infers from the daybook that Grenfell accompanied Hogarth on this trip, leaving Hunt in charge of the dig: in a subsequent letter, Hogarth remarks that Grenfell has been doing pretty well in his absence (“Lots of papyrus”): Hogarth to Laura V. Hogarth, (8 February 1896): P452/PER/2/2/2. </p></note> We can therefore pinpoint the purchase of the Hogarth / Bevan papyri to the first few days of February 1896.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn25" n="25"><p style="text-align: left; "> Hogarth spent two days in Luxor before heading to Assuan for three days, and then another three days in Luxor before returning to the Fayum.

               <p xml:id="p8" style="text-align: left; ">But there is more to this group of papyri than meets the eye. When the British Museum transferred its collection of Greek papyri to the British Library, the Hogarth / Bevan papyri were divided by language and the non-Greek portion of the lot obscured. Along with other papyri written in Egyptian scripts, the museum’s Egyptian Department retained a group of Demotic papyri (EA10491–10505) that its catalogue states “were all acquired as a single lot in 1896 and form the archive of a single family in Gebelen.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn26" n="26"><p style="text-align: left; "> See <ref target="https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/Y_EA10491">https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/Y_EA10491</ref>.

The catalogue’s full report is that “The Group of demotic papyri no.10491–10505 were all acquired as a single lot in 1896 and form the archive of a single family in Gebelen. Some show some connection with other Gebelen papyri published by Spiegelberg in the Strassburg dem. papyri, + with some Greek ones published in P. Grenf. 2. They extend from B.C. 125 to 88. More papyri of this archive were acquired in 1899 (nos. 10510–18) and in 1901 (nos. 10521, 10533–4).”</p></note> </p>
               <p xml:id="p9" style="text-align: left; ">These Demotic papyri belong to the same group whose Greek texts were published for the most part in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95162">P.Grenf. 2</ref>; the Greek docket of EA10504, in fact, was published as <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1478">P.Grenf. 2 34</ref>. Hogarth and Bevan go unmentioned in the museum’s records, but the “single lot” from 1896 was evidently the same purchase from February 1896 described above. The catalogue’s silence on this front is curious, but is evidently the by-product of the museum’s transfer of Greek papyri to the British Library, which included archival material from the Manuscripts Department. Put simply, the true origin of the papyri never reached the Egyptian Department. Yet the presence of Demotic material in the batch is certain: records now in the British Library describe a 16 July 1896 report by Edward Scott (Keeper of Manuscripts) which recommended the purchase from Hogarth of twelve Greek and ten Demotic papyri “of the same period” for the price of £40, with a concurring opinion from E. A. Wallis Budge which assessed the value of the Demotic pieces at £10. Hogarth’s lot certainly included Demotic papyri from Pathyris.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn27" n="27"><p style="text-align: left; "> The other five Demotic papyri in the group were presumably the property of Bevan. The latter man’s donation, by contrast, required no outlay of funds and therefore no equivalent recommendation by the museum’s Keeper. </p></note></p>
               <p xml:id="p10" style="text-align: left; ">Occurring as it did in the middle of his Fayum season with Grenfell, both the circumstances of Hogarth’s purchase of papyri in Luxor and his motivation for leaving camp to travel upriver are unclear. The desert wind and nighttime cold were evidently factors (“Never again will I dig in the Fayum before February!”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn28" n="28"><p style="text-align: left; "> Hogarth to Laura V. Hogarth, Kûm el Atl (19 January 1896): P452/PER/2/2/3.</p></note> he complains at one point), but shopping was also on his mind: a few days later, he despondently reports “I am not going to get any more papyri, I fear.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn29" n="29"><p style="text-align: left; "> Hogarth explains in the same letter that, on account of the Duke of Cambridge’s visit to the area, “prices are firm.” Hogarth to Laura V. Hogarth, Luxor (8 February 1896): P452/PER/2/2/2. In an earlier letter, Hogarth offers a different explanation for leaving camp: “I am planning an expedition up River about Feb. 15 to get through much of Ramadân. After that return here.” Hogarth to Laura V. Hogarth, Kûm Washîm, Sennures, Fayûm (4 January 1896): P452/PER/2/2/2. He later reconsidered the timing of the trip: “I am very probably going up the Nile earlier than I had planned – in fact next Saturday. If I defer it until the middle of February it seems highly probable that I shall be away when this dig comes to an end, which won’t do. For I must see personally to the packing + winding up. So I shall take a fortnight now.” Hogarth to Laura V. Hogarth, Kûm el Atl (21 January postscript to 19 January 1896): P452/PER/2/2/3. His excavation daybook occasionally records browsing for antiquities: while in Tamiya on a day trip that nearly ended in disaster, for example, he “saw Coptic vellum lectionary ? + one or two papyri” (10 January 1896): P452/ARC/3/3.</p></note> It remains unclear how Bevan and Hogarth divided the papyri between them or whether Hogarth contributed any of his own funds to the purchase, but since £50 is quite a sum for several dozen papyri, I suspect that the answer to the latter is ‘no’: unless Hogarth did not spend the entire amount, he failed to drive a very hard bargain. Only when the fifteen Demotic papyri are reckoned as part of this lot does the price – £50 for ca. 45 papyri – appear more reasonable. In any event, the timeline demonstrates that Grenfell and Hunt required fewer than six months to prepare the Greek texts for publication.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn30" n="30"><p style="text-align: left; "> No doubt the voyage home provided ample opportunity for work; Hogarth reports that, although excavated objects were shipped separately after being cleared at Ghizeh, he and Grenfell would “bring to England a large number of other papyri bought in various parts of Egypt”, evidently in person. See, respectively, his letters to Laura V. Hogarth, Hotel d’Angleterre, Cairo (8 March 1896): P452/PER/2/2/2; and to Herbert Grueber, Mena House Hotel, Cairo (14 March 1896), transcribed in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/65966">Montserrat (1996: 167–171)</ref>. The latter is housed in the archives of the Egypt Exploration Society (EES Inv. III k 139).</p></note></p>
               <p xml:id="p11" style="text-align: left; ">Museum archaeology also clarifies aspects of two other Hogarth papyri published in the same volume – <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/11360">P.Grenf. 2 57</ref> and <ref target="https://papyri.info/ddbdp/p.grenf;2;79coli">P.Grenf. 2 79</ref> – which had previously proved confounding. The editions of these two texts state that they are kept “In the Museum of Winchester College,” but the college has no record of receiving or of ever possessing them.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn31" n="31"><p style="text-align: left; "> Prior to mine, inquiries on this topic were certainly made in 1968 by Jean Bingen (via T. C. Skeat in the British Museum) as well as by P. J. Sijpesteijn in 1981. The only papyri now in the college’s treasury are the distributed papyri <ref target="https://papyri.info/ddbdp/p.oxy;1;80">P.Oxy. 1 80</ref> and <ref target="https://papyri.info/dclp/63934">P.Oxy. 1 124</ref>: a third papyrus distributed to it by the EES – <ref target="https://papyri.info/ddbdp/p.oxy;12;1580">P.Oxy. 12 1580</ref> – is lost.</p></note> It is now clear why that is the case: far from being lost, they were included in the 15 May 1935 donation of Hogarth papyri to the Bodleian Library, where they now bear the shelfmarks MS. Gr. class. e. 130 (P) and MS Gr. class. d. 143 (P), respectively (Figures 1–3).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn32" n="32"><p style="text-align: left; "> In publishing the latter (= <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/14121">SB VI 9192</ref>), <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/36243">Wegener (1937: 211, no. III)</ref> did note that two of its columns had been published in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95162">P.Grenf. 2</ref>, but she did not remark upon its alleged location in Winchester College. My correspondence with Amin Benaissa on the topic of Hogarth’s papyri alerted me to the presence of <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/11360">P.Grenf. 2 57</ref> in the Bodleian. </p></note> The likeliest explanation for what happened is that Hogarth had mused to Grenfell and Hunt about donating these two papyri to Winchester College, but never followed through. Grenfell and Hunt reported dutifully in print what they had been told, while the papyri remained in Hogarth’s personal collection until his death. These two texts are notable in other ways, too. Unlike the other <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95162">P.Grenf. 2</ref> texts that are now in London, <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/11360">P.Grenf. 2 57</ref> and <ref target="https://papyri.info/ddbdp/p.grenf;2;79coli">P.Grenf. 2 79</ref> do not originate in Pathyris, and it is therefore unclear whether they were part of Hogarth’s February 1896 Luxor purchase or were acquired on another occasion. If the latter, Hogarth’s extant personal correspondence does not remark upon their acquisition. </p>
               <p xml:id="p12" style="text-align: left; ">Although Hogarth did not follow through with the proposed donation to Winchester, it is clear that, already in 1896, his personal collection of antiquities included papyri. That he possessed a collection at all should not surprise; like other archaeologists of his era,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn33" n="33"><p style="text-align: left; "> See <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/84769">Hagen and Ryholt 2016: 42–52</ref>.</p></note> Hogarth was active on the market during his travels. His trip upriver in the winter of 1895/6 testifies to his appetite for papyri, but so too does his daybook from the 1893/4 Deir el-Bahri excavation describe shopping for ‘anticas’ (as he terms them) in Luxor.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn34" n="34"><p style="text-align: left; "> See the entries for 16 March and 19 March 1894: P452/ARC/3/1. On the former occasion, in Luxor, Hogarth writes “Went to Idris’ shop but saw nothing to buy + left. Ahmed Yusuf’s papyri alone.” That objects were available for sale was immediately evident to him: one of his first letters from Egypt, after reaching Deir el-Bahri, complains that there were dealers “hovering round like flies.” Hogarth to Charles R. Fletcher, Luxor (5 January 1894): P452/PER/2/5/1.</p></note> That autumn, he had even purchased a wedding present for his wife from the proceeds of a sale to the Ashmolean Museum.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn35" n="35"><p style="text-align: left; "> Hogarth to Laura V. Uppleby, Magdalen (23 October 1894): P452/PER/2/2/1.

               <p xml:id="p13" style="text-align: left; ">When exactly Hogarth’s interest in acquiring papyri stirred cannot be determined, but the aforementioned daybook from his first season at Deir el-Bahri (1893/4) suggests that his relationship with Grenfell – a man several years his junior – was a contributing factor. The Deir el-Bahri dig was uncovering Coptic ostraca as well as bits of Demotic and Coptic papyri, but Hogarth does not seem terribly excited by them (or even by the dig).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn36" n="36"><p style="text-align: left; "> On such finds, see Hogarth to Charles R. Fletcher, Luxor (5 January 1894): P452/PER/2/5/1, and cf. the daybook entry for 17 January 1894 (P452/ARC/3/1): “Find little to do + must take to Coptic + Demotic.”</p></note> Grenfell’s visits to the site were rather more remarkable. The two collaborated on inscriptions and discussed the younger man’s future, and were familiar enough that Hogarth slept in Grenfell’s room.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn37" n="37"><p style="text-align: left; "> Daybook entry for 20 January 1894 (P452/ARC/3/1), noted also by <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/65966">Montserrat (1996: 139–140)</ref>.</p></note> On a subsequent visit, Grenfell told Hogarth about his plans “for Gurob, Mendes, and Manfalut.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn38" n="38"><p style="text-align: left; "> Daybook entry for 28 February 1894 (P452/ARC/3/1).</p></note> Back in Cairo at the conclusion of the season, they continued to socialize: on 23 March 1894, Grenfell came to dine, prompting the update that “His walks etc. in Fayum failed at Manfalut.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn39" n="39"><p style="text-align: left; "> Daybook entry for 23 March 1894 (P452/ARC/3/1).</p></note> Less than a week later, following a visit to Ghizeh with Édouard Naville, Hogarth received an initiation of sorts:</p>

</quote>
               <p xml:id="p14" style="text-align: left; ">In 1894 Grenfell was already acquiring Greek papyri and had certainly introduced his Oxford colleague to them. Well before the Fund tasked them with leading it, in other words, the seeds of the 1895/6 Fayum expedition were planted. The two men were well acquainted, and Hogarth the archaeologist was by no means ignorant of papyrology and its potential. </p>
               <p xml:id="p15" style="text-align: left; ">Hogarth’s personal correspondence confirms that, even after resigning from the Fund, he continued to acquire papyri. In the winter of 1896/7, prior to taking up the position of Director of the British School in Athens in October 1897, he returned to Egypt. His letters from this period are especially revealing. After arriving in Cairo from Ismailia on the final day of 1896, for example, he laments how empty the city is.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn41" n="41"><p style="text-align: left; "> Other letters make clear that an outbreak of cholera is to blame: see, e.g., Hogarth to Charles R.

               <p xml:id="p19" style="text-align: left; ">In light of the above, Hogarth seems to have acquired other papyri in the winter of 1896/7. He was certainly active in the market and relatively unencumbered with business, and the £50 windfall he was due for checking in at Deir el-Bahri at Thompson’s request could well have been earmarked for this purpose. The fact that he both intended to write about papyri and had visited Grenfell and Hunt’s camp suggests that the topic was very much on his mind. Although he was no longer personally excavating them, the memory of the Fayum season was nonetheless fresh, and a fondness for Grenfell – presumably shared by his wife (to whom most of the correspondence is addressed) – permeates the letters of this winter. He reports on the hazards of camp life at Behnesa<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn49" n="49"><p style="text-align: left; "> “Grenfell doing well but going in fear of his life from Bedowîn.” Hogarth to Laura V. Hogarth, Luxor (7 February 1897): P452/PER/2/2/3. The incident in question is presumably the raid Grenfell mentions in his letter to Edward Maunde Thompson, Beni-Mazar, Upper Egypt (30 January 1897): EES, DIST.15.04, transcribed by <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/96090">Hickey and Keenan (2016: 359–363, on 361–362)</ref>. That the raid took place following the conclusion of Hogarth’s visit to Behnesa implies that the two men remained in correspondence afterward.</p></note> and, after considering but declining an invitation to visit the Great Oasis, recommends that Grenfell take his place.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn50" n="50"><p style="text-align: left; "> Cf. Hogarth’s remarks of a week later: “So I consider myself absolved of all promises to him [sc. Blundell]: + I have written to Grenfell urging him to take my place. For B., in spite of delays, moans about having no companion. I regret a little but not very deeply. To have seen the Great Oasis would have about completed my knowledge of Egypt: but nothing that I found there would have been really in my line. Even possible papyri are far more in Grenfell’s.” Hogarth to Laura V. Hogarth, Hotel d’Angleterre, Cairo (14 February 1897): P452/PER/2/2/3.</p></note> By contrast, he mentions Hunt by name only once.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn51" n="51"><p style="text-align: left; "> See fn. 43. Hunt is equally a minor figure in Hogarth’s correspondence from the Fayum in 1895/6: “He is very quiet, + doesn’t help on things much but is distinctly a nice man.” Hogarth to Laura V. Hogarth, Sennures (1 March 1896): P452/PER/2/2/2.</p></note> Of course, Hogarth would return to Egypt on other occasions over the course of his career,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn52" n="52"><p style="text-align: left; "> Most notable are his excavations at Naukratis in February 1899 and 1903 (on which see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/14863">Leonard 1997: 10–17</ref>), but also his wartime activities on the Arab Bureau. The latter are unlikely to have yielded much: in 1920, when Francis W. Kelsey and Grenfell were shopping for papyri in Cairo, they believed they were among the first to see the monumental collection of Maurice Nahman, who claimed to have been assembling it for the past six years. This collection would become the core of the founding purchase of Michigan papyri. On Kelsey and Grenfell’s collaboration, see Todd Hickey’s introductions to the forthcoming P.Lond. 8 and P.Mich.Cent.</p></note> but the evidence such as it is suggests that his acquisitions were concentrated in and around his first years in Egypt, the period in which his interactions with Grenfell were most frequent.</p>
