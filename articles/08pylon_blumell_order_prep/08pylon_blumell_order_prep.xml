            <note type="acknowledgement">We want to thank the L. Tom Perry Special Collections staff at the Harold B.

               <head>In 1981, Brigham Young University (BYU) acquired a small collection of papyri and ostraca through Aziz Atiya, Professor of Languages and History at the University of Utah.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1">
                     <p style="text-align: left; "> On the BYU collection acquired from Atiya, see discussions in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/86542">Blumell 2013</ref>: 182 and <ref target="https://lockwoodonlinejournals.com/index.php/jcscs/article/view/114">Blumell and Wayment 2014</ref>: 59–60. </p>
                  </note> Atiya approached BYU to sell some of the Greek and Coptic materials he had amassed in his personal collection since he was refining it to reflect his primary interest in Arabic documents. Since the late 1940s, Atiya had been acquiring Greek, Coptic, and Arabic texts from his native Egypt, and when he joined the University of Utah in 1959, he brought many of these with him. In the 1981 purchase agreement with Atiya, the Harold B. Lee Library acquisition records report the purchase of 20 ostraca (inv. nos. 67–87).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2">
                     <p style="text-align: left; "> Most of the ostraca preserve Coptic text, but three preserve Greek text (inv. nos. 68, 72, 79). Unfortunately, neither the acquisition records, the library’s catalog, nor any of Atiya’s extant correspondence mentions the ostraca’s provenance.</p>

               <head>Ostracon inv. no. 67 preserves a document written in Coptic (Sahidic) consisting of 12 lines of text, inscribed on the convex side. The ostracon is reddish-brown or terracotta in color. It has ribbing on the upper portion that transitions to a smoother side, suggesting that the sherd was once part of a truncated, cone-shaped transport amphora.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3">
                     <p style="text-align: left; "> The ostracon may have come from amphora Type AE 3T-3.1; see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/79333">Dixneuf 2011</ref>: 138–40, fig. 127.  </p>
                  </note> The ink has a dark brown, almost black, hue. The top, right, and bottom margins of the text are preserved. For the first six lines, the opening text of each is lost, with at most 4 or 5 characters missing. But with each successive line, based on the breakage of the ostracon, the missing text progressively diminishes. The lost text can be confidently restored.</head>
               <head>	Letters are written clearly and consistently with well-spaced lines, and many letters are written with a slight right-leaning tilt. While letters generally lack any ornate features, the left end of the crossbar of the tau often contains a small but distinct serif. The writer consistently uses a macron to mark the e-vowel and inserts a trema over the iota. </head>
               <head>The document, which preserves an order, is terse and to the point and contains considerable implicit information. It is sent from a person identified as “John, the chief attendant” (ⲁⲣⲭⲩⲡⲉⲣⲉⲧⲏⲥ) and is addressed “to the village headmen of Tin” (ⲛ̅ⲛ̅ⲗⲁϣⲛⲏⲩ ⲛ︦ⲧⲓⲛ). John opens the document by reporting that an unnamed man had come to him and reported mistreatment at the hands of the group: specifically, that they had dismissed him from a “field-share” (ⲟⲩⲙⲉⲣⲟⲥ ⲛ︦ϩⲟⲓ̈) and had given it to someone else. John informs the village officials that their actions were unjust and reminds them that he had previously instructed them to leave the man there. Given the reference to “Tin,” a village located in Upper Egypt on the west side of the Nile, almost 20 km south of Ptolemais Hermeiou, it can reasonably be assumed that the land was not located too far away.</head>
               <head>There are many scenarios that could involve the removal or reassignment of individuals to land. <ref target="http://papyri.info/apis/duke.apis.32143626">P.Duk.inv. 839 R</ref> and <ref target="http://papyri.info/apis/duke.apis.32143628">P.Duk.inv. 839 V</ref> illustrate an example of the assignment of individuals to a piece of land, revealing a situation where instructions are given to appoint men to a place on an island (ⲙⲟⲩ) and give them wages. Another situation that may entail the reassignment of land is a dispute, as in <ref target="http://papyri.info/ddbdp/p.kru%3B%3B50">P.KRU 50</ref>, which illustrates an argument where divisions of what may be an estate are negotiated. Along this line, the present document could fit into a larger conversation about a dispute over a “field-share” being negotiated by the village headmen. However, there are other possibilities that may result in the removal and assignment of individuals to land, and the evidence in this document is insufficient to determine the specific situation it addresses.</head>
               <head>	A date for the document falling somewhere in the sixth to eighth centuries is likely. Paleographically, the hand shares graphic features that can be found in dated Coptic texts from this period: e.g., <ref target="https://papyri.info/ddbdp/p.prag%3B1%3B46">P.Prag. 1.46</ref> (A.D. 522; Antinoopolis)<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="4">
                     <p style="text-align: left; "> While this text is written in Greek, the last line on the verso is written in Coptic.</p>
                  </note> and <ref target="https://papyri.info/ddbdp/sb%3B1%3B5123">P.KRU 10</ref> (8 Dec. A.D. 722; Thebes ?). Furthermore, the title ⲗⲁϣⲁⲛⲉ (“village head man”) appears in texts typically thought to date between the sixth and eighth centuries.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5" n="5">

Someone came to me and said that you (pl.) have dismissed him from a field-share and assigned it to someone else. This is an injustice! I have told you (pl.) on another occasion: “Do not remove and do not reassign.” The place (i.e., the disputed field-share) where the man was, leave him there. Give it (i.e., the document) to the village headmen of Tin. From John, the chief attendant.
