The most widely accepted reading of the inscription is <seg style="font-style: italic;">domine ivimus</seg> (‘Lord, we have come/we went’), which carries clear Christian implications. This interpretation was recently reiterated by the editor of the piece (<ref target="https://edh.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/edh/inschrift/HD051018">I.2 787</ref>) in <seg style="font-style: italic;">CIIP</seg>, the most comprehensive edition of inscriptions from present-day Israel and the Palestinian Authority, without a proper critical evaluation. Since its discovery, however, the inscription has generated considerable scholarly attention and controversy, especially regarding its interpretation as either pagan or Christian.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1"><p style="text-align: left; "> See <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97029">Gibson and Taylor 1994</ref>: 25–48; A. Walls n.d. </p></note> In what follows, we primarily argue from a linguistic perspective that the interpretation <seg style="font-style: italic;">domine ivimus</seg> is untenable. Instead, we assert the likelihood of the reading <seg style="font-style: italic;">Isis Mirionimus </seg>(‘Isis of countless names’) as originally proposed by Humphreys in 1974.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2"><p style="text-align: left; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97023">Humphreys 1974</ref>.</p></note></p>

               <p xml:id="p2" style="text-align: justify;">The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is a large complex of structures situated in the Christian Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City. It was initially constructed during the reign of Constantine I in the 4th century AD, atop the remnants of demolished Hadrianic public structures. Over the centuries, it has faced numerous cycles of damage, rebuilding, and even complete redesign. Most of the surviving structures date to the Crusader period. At the eastern edge of the church complex lies the Chapel of St. Helena, currently under the custody of the Armenian Patriarchate. In 1970, the Patriarchate initiated excavations in the chapel to investigate whether there was an empty space or bedrock behind the apses of St. Helena. The excavation revealed a space that had been blocked since antiquity, now recognized as the Chapel of St. Vartan. </p>
               <p xml:id="p3" style="text-align: justify;">In 1971, the Armenian Patriarchate invited Archie Walls and Sven Helms from the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem to oversee the excavation. Inside the chapel, they discovered a smooth-faced ashlar that displayed a drawing of a merchant vessel along with an inscription (Fig. 1).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3"><p style="text-align: left; "> For the inscription in its archaeological context, see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97027">Broshi and Barkay 1985</ref>; <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97029">Gibson and Taylor 1994</ref>: 25–48; <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97028">Kelley 2019</ref>: 44–60.</p></note> However, their finding was only made public in a paired article by Bennet and Humphreys in 1974.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="4"><p style="text-align: left; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97022">Bennett 1974</ref>; <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97023">Humphreys 1974</ref>.</p></note> The stone is situated on a wall that served as part of the foundation for both Hadrian's 2nd-century AD structure and Constantine's Basilica, both of which were backfilled to provide support for the upper constructions.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5" n="5"><p style="text-align: left; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97028">Kelley 2019</ref>: 60.</p></note> This location for a detailed drawing and inscription poses some challenges regarding its dating. Two possibilities seem most plausible. Broshi and Barkay suggest that the drawing and inscription were likely created during the construction of the Constantinian Basilica, between approximately 325 and 335 AD.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn6" n="6"><p style="text-align: left; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97027">Broshi and Barkay 1985</ref>: 124; see also <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97028">Kelley 2019</ref>: 55.</p></note> In contrast, Gibson and Taylor, considering the archaeological context of the stone and the depiction of the ship, date it to the 2nd century AD.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn7" n="7"><p style="text-align: left; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97029">Gibson and Taylor 1994</ref>: 42, 47–48.</p></note></p>

               <p xml:id="p4" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">A comparison of the drawing and inscription, based on the photograph taken within 24 hours of the 1971 excavation (Fig. 1) and another captured in 1975 (Fig. 2) following a cleaning process, reveals notable differences between the two. After the British Institute had left, the Armenian Patriarchate entrusted the Franciscan Fr Emmanuele Testa with the task of cleaning the stone in 1975. The editor of <seg style="font-style: italic;">CIIP</seg> states that Helms, who discovered the stone with A. Walls in 1971, baselessly accused Testa of having changed the inscription during the cleaning process.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn8" n="8"><p style="text-align: left; "> <seg style="font-style: italic;">CIIP</seg> 787: 92.</p></note> However, Helms had valid grounds for raising concerns in this regard.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn9" n="9"><p style="text-align: left; "> Outlined in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97025">Helms 1980</ref>; see also Walls n.d.; <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97029">Gibson and Taylor 1994</ref>: 31–34.</p></note> Soon after the discovery of the ship, Helms engaged in a discussion with Father Pierre Benoit of École Biblique in Jerusalem regarding the interpretation of the inscription.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn10" n="10"><p style="text-align: left; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97025">Helms 1980</ref>: 109–110.</p></note> Following a quick ocular inspection on the excavation site,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn11" n="11"><p style="text-align: left; "> Walls n.d.: 4; <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97025">Helms 1980</ref>: 109.</p></note> Benoit immediately ended up with a Christian reading <seg style="font-style: italic;">domine ivimus,</seg> while Helms supported the interpretation <seg style="font-style: italic;">Isis Mirionimus</seg>. Testa sided with Father Benoit, and it is unclear to us if he was even aware of Helms’ reading. The precise details of the cleaning process remain unknown. According to Testa, the cleaning was performed with a ‘chemical substance’, while other testimonies mention the use of leather and oil, as well as pig fat.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn12" n="12"><p style="text-align: left; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97036">Testa 1976</ref>: 219; <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97029">Gibson and Taylor 1994</ref>: 32.</p></note> On January 12, 1977, the Criminal Identification Bureau of the Israel Police examined the inscription using infrared illumination. According to Broshi and Barkay, the investigation confirmed that the drawing or the inscription had not been altered in any way.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn13" n="13"><p style="text-align: left; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97027">Broshi and Barkay 1985</ref>: 128.</p></note> However, as Gibson and Taylor accurately point out, although infrared illumination can detect the presence of absorbed pigments in porous and, especially, organic materials, there are significant reasons to question whether it can reveal any lines on stone surfaces that would not already be visible to the naked eye.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn14" n="14"><p style="text-align: left; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97029">Gibson and Taylor 1994</ref>: 33–34</p></note> In any event, the alteration of the original drawing and inscription resulting from the cleaning process appears evident.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn15" n="15"><p style="text-align: left; "> See <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97025">Helms 1980</ref>: 106 (fig. 1) and the discussion therein; <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97029">Gibson and Taylor 1994</ref>: 34.</p></note> </p>

               <p xml:id="p5" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The initial point of interest in the inscription should lie in the peculiar verb form <seg style="font-style: italic;">ivimus. </seg>The editor of the <seg style="font-style: italic;">CIIP </seg>interprets it as the uncontracted first-person plural perfect of the Latin verb <seg style="font-style: italic;">ire, </seg>meaning ‘to go’. Strangely enough, the editor chooses to translate the phrase as ‘Lord, we have come’ instead of the expected ‘Lord, we went’. This interpretation would presume that the verb <seg style="font-style: italic;">ire</seg> was also used to indicate arrival. Judging from thousands of occurrences from different periods of Latinity, the verb <seg style="font-style: italic;">ire</seg> had nearly the same semantic extension in Latin as the English <seg style="font-style: italic;">go</seg>, denoting every kind of motion for animate or inanimate things: walking, riding, sailing, flying, moving, passing, and so on.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn16" n="16"><p style="text-align: left; "> <seg style="font-style: italic;">Thesaurus Linguae Latinae</seg>, <ref target="https://publikationen.badw.de/de/000924309/pdf/CC%20BY-NC-ND/ThLL%20vol.%2005,2%20col.%200001%E2%80%930758%20(e%E2%80%93ergenna)"><seg style="text-decoration: underline;">s.v. eo</seg></ref>.</p></note> In what follows, we investigate whether there is any evidence indicating that <seg style="font-style: italic;">ire</seg> might also have signified arrival at some chronological stage of Latin, in the way it does in modern Ibero-Romance languages. These languages descending from Latin could theoretically continue a previously unknown Vulgar Latin usage, with <seg style="font-style: italic;">ivimus</seg> attested in the inscription as a unique manifestation of it. </p>
               <p xml:id="p6" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">In modern Spanish, the motion verbs <seg style="font-style: italic;">ir</seg> (&lt; Lat. <seg style="font-style: italic;">ire</seg>) and <seg style="font-style: italic;">venir</seg> (&lt; Lat. <seg style="font-style: italic;">venire</seg>) both express the movement of something or someone from one point to another, using the speaker’s physical position at the moment of the utterance as the point of reference.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn17" n="17"><p style="text-align: left; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97033">Suadoni 2016</ref>: 82.</p></note> The verb <seg style="font-style: italic;">ir</seg> indicates speaker’s movement from their current place to another, regardless of the location of the person they are addressing. Consider the following example:</p>
               <quote>
                  <lb/>– Esta noche voy a la misa con Dolores. ¿Vienes? (verb <seg style="font-style: italic;">venir</seg>) ‘Tonight I’m going to the mass with Dolores. Are you coming?’ (verb <seg style="font-style: italic;">to come</seg>)
</quote>
               <p xml:id="p7" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The pattern differs from English and many other European languages, in which the positions of both the speaker and the addressee together determine the selection between the two verbs. While the general behaviour of Latin motion verbs more closely resembles English than Spanish, cases of <seg style="font-style: italic;">ire</seg> in places where one might expect <seg style="font-style: italic;">venire</seg> appear in Old Latin, especially in the comedies of Plautus and Terence:</p>
               <quote>
                  <lb/>
                  <seg style="font-style: italic;">Euge Astaphium eccam it mihi advorsum</seg>. ’Great! Astaphium comes to meet me.’ (Plautus, <seg style="font-style: italic;">Truculentus</seg> 503, c. 200 BC, where <seg style="font-style: italic;">it</seg> is the third-person singular present indicative of <seg style="font-style: italic;">ire</seg>)
</quote>
               <p xml:id="p8" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">However, the system that arises from Old Latin comedies differs from that of Spanish. <seg style="font-style: italic;">Venire</seg> is consistently the most typical verb in sentences like the ones above, and, most importantly, the question ‘Where do you come from?’ cannot be expressed with <seg style="font-style: italic;">ir</seg> in Spanish. Rather than indicating the speaker’s position, the Old Latin system seems to be based on Aktionsart: the Latin <seg style="font-style: italic;">ire</seg> encodes events that are predominantly atelic, i.e., presented as heading for no specific endpoint, while <seg style="font-style: italic;">venire</seg> encodes events that are predominantly telic, i.e., presented as heading for a specific endpoint.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn18" n="18"><p style="text-align: left; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97031">Ricca 1991</ref>: 166–175.</p></note> In the present discussion, the crucial point is that due to its very atelicity, <seg style="font-style: italic;">ire</seg> is hardly precise enough to express the meaning of arrival in an utterance like <seg style="font-style: italic;">domine ivimus</seg>. The verb is too vague to convey the meaning ‘Lord, we have come/arrived’. Therefore, one would expect <seg style="font-style: italic;">domine venimus</seg> instead, perhaps accompanied by a clarifying prepositional phrase such as <seg style="font-style: italic;">ad te</seg> ‘to you’ (cf. <seg style="font-style: italic;">mihi advorsum</seg> ‘towards/to me’ and <seg style="font-style: italic;">unde</seg> ‘wherefrom’ above), assuming that the writer pursued the meaning that the proponents of the reading <seg style="font-style: italic;">domine ivimus</seg> seem to postulate. In summary, surviving Latin sources offer no indication whatsoever to legitimize the reading “we have come” in such brief and uncontextualized phrases as <seg style="font-style: italic;">domine ivimus</seg>. </p>
               <p xml:id="p9" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Highly pertinent to the present discussion is also the fact that the uncontracted plural perfect<seg style="font-style: italic;"> ivimus</seg>, in contrast to the contracted <seg style="font-style: italic;">īmus</seg>, is, as far as we can tell, never attested in Latin inscriptions or Classical literature.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn19" n="19"><p style="text-align: left; ">  <seg style="font-style: italic;">Ivimus </seg>is attested a few times in Late Latin literature, including one instance in the Vulgate 2 Kings 7,10: <seg style="font-style: italic;">ad castra Syriae ivimus </seg>(‘We went to the camp of the Syrians’). It is worth noting that the Vulgate emerged almost a century after the latest production estimate for the inscription. Curiously, this detail seems to have eluded scholars who seek parallels between the Vulgate and the inscription in question. In any case, the uncontracted form is characteristic of the Christian writers of Late Antiquity, reflecting their inclination toward morphological explicitness, and certainly was not part of everyday spoken Latin in the Imperial period.</p></note> Instead, one might be tempted to interpret<seg style="font-style: italic;"> ivimus</seg> as <seg style="font-style: italic;">ibimus</seg>, where <seg style="font-style: italic;">b</seg> has been substituted by <seg style="font-style: italic;">v</seg>. Contrary to what Gibson and Taylor claim, the spelling <seg style="font-style: italic;">v </seg>for <seg style="font-style: italic;">b </seg>is not about “the rare substitution of <seg style="font-style: italic;">v</seg> for <seg style="font-style: italic;">b</seg>”, but one of the most frequent spelling variations of non-literary Imperial and Late Latin.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn20" n="20"><p style="text-align: left; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97029">Gibson and Taylor 1994</ref>: 46.</p></note> The original Latin sounds /b/ and /w/, marked with the letters <seg style="font-style: italic;">b</seg> and <seg style="font-style: italic;">v,</seg> respectively, had both become a bilabial fricative /β/ in intervocalic position during the first century AD, understandably causing non-classical spellings among the less educated.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn21" n="21"><p style="text-align: left; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97032">Väänänen 1981</ref>: 21.</p></note> </p>
               <p xml:id="p10" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">In the absence of specific context, each verb lexeme is bound to appear in its generic meaning. Thus, the perfect <seg style="font-style: italic;">ivimus</seg> translates neutrally as ‘we went’ and the future <seg style="font-style: italic;">ibimus</seg> as ‘we will go’. In Imperial and Late Popular Latin, the future acquired an additional hortative meaning, allowing for a translation as ‘let us go’ as well. None of these is compatible with the reading ‘Lord, we have come’ proposed in <seg style="font-style: italic;">CIIP</seg>. Curiously, the editor of <seg style="font-style: italic;">CIIP </seg>supports his interpretation with two references to the Bible which, however, quote <seg style="font-style: italic;">ire</seg> in the future tense and clearly speak of ‘going’, not of ‘coming’ or ‘arriving’:</p>
               <quote>
                  <lb/>The text recalls Psalm 121,1: “In domum Domini ibimus” = “Let us go to the house of the Lord”. There could also be an allusion to Jn 6,68: “Domine ad quem ibimus?” = “Lord, to whom shall we go (turn)?” It expresses the relief felt by Christian pilgrims arriving in the Holy Land and being close to Christ’s burial place.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn22" n="22">

                  </note>
               </quote>
               <p xml:id="p11" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Gibson and Taylor also appear to confuse going with coming. While discussing the interpretation ‘Lord, we will go’, they first duly note that:</p>
               <quote>
                  <lb/>a Future tense is not consistent with an image that shows a completed action. The juxtaposition of the drawing of a ship in port after its voyage and the inscription which would naturally be in the Perfect tense is logical.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn23" n="23">
                     <p style="text-align: left; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97029">Gibson and Taylor 1994</ref>: 46.</p>
                  </note>
               </quote>
               <p xml:id="p12" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">After that, however, they hypothesise about an alternative reading, <seg style="font-style: italic;">domino ivimus</seg>, and translate it as “we came to the Lord”.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn24" n="24"><p style="text-align: left; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97029">Gibson and Taylor 1994</ref>: 47.</p></note> This seemingly unconscious mistake is understandable because ‘to come’ is, indeed, the verb one expects to see in a context of arriving somewhere, not ‘to go’. The generic Latin verbs that denote coming to or arriving at a place are <seg style="font-style: italic;">venire</seg> and <seg style="font-style: italic;">advenire</seg> or, in Later Latin, also <seg style="font-style: italic;">plicare</seg> (<seg style="font-style: italic;">se</seg>) (originally ‘to fold’), <seg style="font-style: italic;">jungere se</seg> (originally ‘to join’), and <seg style="font-style: italic;">arripare</seg> (originally ‘to go ashore’).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn25" n="25"><p style="text-align: left; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97032">Väänänen 1981</ref>: 21.</p></note> </p>
               <p xml:id="p13" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Broshi is more systematic and translates ‘Lord, we went’, while referring to Psalm 121 [122], which he describes as the classical psalm of the pilgrim to Jerusalem.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn26" n="26"><p style="text-align: left; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97024">Broshi 1977</ref>: 349.</p></note> He interprets <seg style="font-style: italic;">domine ivimus</seg> as “the joyous exclamation of pilgrims who sailed from the western part of the Empire and finally reached the Holy City”. Broshi and Barkay, however, opt for the translation ‘Lord, we shall go’, duly mentioning the substitution of <seg style="font-style: italic;">b</seg> with <seg style="font-style: italic;">v </seg>and associating the phrase with the Psalm 121 [122] and Jn 6,68.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn27" n="27"><p style="text-align: left; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97027">Broshi and Barkay 1985</ref>: 125.</p></note> The suggested biblical parallels seem tenuous at best. A convincing parallel between an inscription and a biblical passage requires unambiguity and transparency. However, this clearly does not apply to the phrase <seg style="font-style: italic;">domine ivimus</seg>, as the first word is one of the most common in the Vulgate, and the second a generic verb. Such parallels can be forged <seg style="font-style: italic;">ad nauseam</seg>. We also find it puzzling why a Latin-speaking pilgrim, who has just arrived in Jerusalem, would express ‘his relief’ or ‘joy’ in the future tense, even if such constructions can be found in random psalms. One might wonder why the pilgrim did not choose phrases like Ezr 8,32: <seg style="font-style: italic;">venimus adorare eum</seg> (‘we have come to worship him’) or Mat 2,2: <seg style="font-style: italic;">venimus Hierusalem </seg>(‘we came to Jerusalem’)<seg style="font-style: italic;">.</seg></p>

               <p xml:id="p14" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">While Gibson and Taylor conclude that there are significant alterations in the current drawing compared to the original, they nonetheless choose to support the <seg style="font-style: italic;">domine ivimus </seg>reading of the inscription, although doubting its Christian content.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn28" n="28"><p style="text-align: left; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97029">Gibson and Taylor 1994</ref>: 33–34.</p></note> Through an analysis of the 1971 photographs (reconstruction in Fig. 3) and certain paleographical considerations, they reach the conclusion that the incontestable letters are likely D-MIN--VIMUS (with three uncertain letters).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn29" n="29"><p style="text-align: left; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97029">Gibson and Taylor 1994</ref>: 42–45.</p></note> We find this perplexing because their reconstruction could easily be interpreted as <seg style="font-style: italic;">Isis Mirionimus</seg> as well. The first two letters are clearly visible in Fig.1: it simply reads IS and not D, followed by I and S. This reading is also supported by the fact that there is a discernible gap after the first four letters (or two if one opts for the reading DO-). The next letter is certainly M, followed by a somewhat uncertain R and I. We cannot read any letter between M and R. I is followed by an O, lacking part of its left side. The last four letters, -IMUS, are indisputable. </p>
               <p xml:id="p15" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">So, the question arises: Why do Gibson and Taylor insist on the <seg style="font-style: italic;">domine ivimus</seg> reading? The reason appears to lie in a linguistic mistake or what they refer to as a ‘gender problem’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn30" n="30"><p style="text-align: left; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97029">Gibson and Taylor 1994</ref>: 44.</p></note> Quoting Humphreys, Taylor and Gibson correctly mention that “ISIS MIRIONIMUS is a phonetic transcription in Roman letters of the Greek ΙΣΙΣ ΜΥΡΙΟΝΥΜΟΣ.”<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn31" n="31"><p style="text-align: left; "> sc. ΜΥΡΙΩΝΥΜΟΣ.</p></note> Next, however, they assert that “Isis, in fact, is never qualified by the masculine -<seg style="font-style: italic;">os</seg> ending”, citing <ref target="https://edh.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/edh/inschrift/HD045778">CIL III 882</ref> (<seg style="font-style: italic;">Isidi Myrionimae</seg>) in support of their argument. In reality, the common Greek epithet qualifying Isis, μυριώνυμος, is not masculine but feminine.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn32" n="32"><p style="text-align: left; "> For a general discussion of the epithet, see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/63762">Bricault 1994</ref>: 67–86.</p></note> Both the masculine and feminine forms of compound adjectives, like μυριώνυμος, exhibit identical endings to those of 2nd-declension masculine nouns in -ος. Furthermore, contrary to what Gibson and Taylor claim, Isis is in fact qualified by the masculine-like ending in Latin inscriptions, as exemplified by <seg style="font-style: italic;">Isidi Myrionymo </seg>(<ref target="https://edh.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/edh/inschrift/HD018954">AE 1956, 244</ref>), which directly renders the Greek dedication Ἴσιδι μυριωνύμῳ in Latin script.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn33" n="33"><p style="text-align: left; "> Also attested as <seg style="font-style: italic;">Isidi M</seg><seg style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">i</seg><seg style="font-style: italic;">rionymo</seg> (<ref target="https://edh.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/edh/inschrift/HD014111">AE 1968, 230</ref>) and <seg style="font-style: italic;">Isidi Myrion</seg><seg style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">i</seg><seg style="font-style: italic;">mo </seg>(<ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97030">Grisonic et al. 2022</ref>: 234) with ‘i’ instead of ‘y’.</p></note> We are tempted to assume that Gibson and Taylor would have been more inclined to support the Isiac reading had they been aware of this fact.</p>

               <p xml:id="p17" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">In this paper, we have shown that the reading <seg style="font-style: italic;">domine ivimus </seg>is highly improbable, given the meaning of the verb <seg style="font-style: italic;">ire</seg> and the apparent absence of the uncontracted form <seg style="font-style: italic;">ivimus</seg> in both spoken language and most literary Latin texts. We consider the reading <seg style="font-style: italic;">Isis Mirionimus</seg> to be the most likely, although acknowledging the need for some doubt as the original inscription seems to be lost. We cannot but endorse Gibson and Taylor’s call for the Armenian Patriarchate to commission an independent analysis of the pigments, which we expect will reveal the tampered parts of the inscription more clearly than is possible with visual inspection alone.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn39" n="39"><p style="text-align: left; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/97029">Gibson and Taylor 1994</ref>: 34.</p></note></p>
