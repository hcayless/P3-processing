               <p xml:id="p1">‘I am very glad the Zeno papyri have arrived safely, and am sure Edgar would be grateful for any information about double dates.’ This quotation is taken from a letter written by Grenfell to Bell on 1 June 1919, shortly after the British Museum had purchased a group of Zenon papyri from the Cairo dealer Maurice Nahman,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Maurice Nahman (1868–1948) was the most famous Cairo dealer at that time; see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/84769">Hagen–Ryholt 2016</ref>: 253–255.</p></note> in April 1919 (P.Lond. inv. 2079–2101). Edgar had recently published two articles on Early Ptolemaic chronology,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar 1917 and Edgar 1918a.</p></note> and had begun the publication of the Zenon papyri of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo in a series of articles.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3"><p style="text-align: justify; "> This series, “Selected Papyri from the Archives of Zenon”, in <seg style="font-style: italic;">Annales du Service des Antiquités</seg>, is referred to as P.Edg. in the <ref target="https://papyri.info/docs/checklist">Checklist</ref>.</p></note> It did not take long for Bell to write to Edgar, whose first letter in this assemblage is dated 12 August 1919. As expected, it concerned the Zenon papyri in London and their dates. The first letter was followed by several others on the same topic; the two correspondents came closer over the years, with ‘Dear Mr Bell’ replaced by the more familiar ‘Dear Bell’ from 1923.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="4"><p style="text-align: justify; "> It is not known whether the two had been in contact earlier. Edgar had turned to papyrology only a few years earlier. They were both students at Oriel College, Oxford, but six years apart: Edgar matriculated in 1891 (not in 1890, as reported in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/36812">Guéraud 1939</ref>: 3, and then <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/76106">Pellé 2007</ref>: 181), having previously studied at Glasgow; and Bell in 1897 (Shadwell 1902: 677, 710).</p></note></p>
               <p xml:id="p2" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Edgar’s letters (Bell’s are not available and may be presumed lost) preserve moments in the history of the making of P.Cair.Zen. and of the nascent stages of the future <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/8390">P.Lond. 7</ref>. Numerous letters discuss readings in Zenon papyri in London and Cairo (<seg style="font-weight: bold;">1</seg>–<seg style="font-weight: bold;">5</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">7</seg>–<seg style="font-weight: bold;">9</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">12</seg>–<seg style="font-weight: bold;">15</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">20</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">27</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">33</seg>), as well as in Manchester (<seg style="font-weight: bold;">30</seg>–<seg style="font-weight: bold;">31</seg>); almost all this discussion resulted in something concrete in the publications. The Zenon papyri acquired by Michigan also make a frequent appearance in the correspondence (<seg style="font-weight: bold;">16</seg>–<seg style="font-weight: bold;">19</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">23</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">29</seg>), chiefly in relation to practicalities of their study and publication. Apart from editorial matters, the history of papyrus collections also receives coverage. The publication of the Zenon papyri in Florence had shown that fragments of the same papyrus could be divided between different collections, and the London acquisitions held the potential for further such joins. If it were discovered that fragments in one collection complete any papyri in the other, would an exchange be possible, as had been done with Florence, ‘to the advantage of both collections’ (<seg style="font-weight: bold;">9</seg>)? ‘There would be no difficulty on our side, but you may perhaps be bound to stricter rules’, Edgar noted. In the end, four London papyri that joined with others in Cairo were included in P.Cair.Zen.,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5" n="5"><p style="text-align: justify; "> P.Lond. inv. 2352, published as part of P.Cair.Zen. 1 59062, and later republished with an additional fragment as <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1510">P.Lond. 7 1943</ref>; inv. 2318A, published in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/804">P.Cair.Zen 2 59156</ref>; inv. 2344, part of <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/828">P.Cair.Zen 2 59182</ref>; and inv. 2320, part of <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1445">P.Cair.Zen 5 59821</ref>. In the preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95110">P.Cair.Zen. 1</ref>, Edgar thanks ‘H. I. Bell for showing me his transcripts of the unpublished material in the British Museum and for kindly enabling me to complete several of the texts in this volume’.</p></note> but the originals remained in London. Cairo, or rather Edgar, presented to London two fragments that physically belonged with inv. 2312 = <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2384">P.Lond. 7 1941</ref> and inv. 2096 = <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1579">P.Lond. 7 2017</ref>.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn6" n="6"><p style="text-align: justify; "> See letters <seg style="font-weight: bold;">8</seg> and <seg style="font-weight: bold;">16</seg>.</p></note></p>
               <p xml:id="p3" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Other letters refer to Petrie papyri in the British Museum, mostly from the <ref target="http://www.trismegistos.org/archive/122">archive of Kleon and Theodoros</ref> (<seg style="font-weight: bold;">2</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">22</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">23</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">25</seg>, <seg style="font-weight: bold;">26</seg>), an assemblage contemporary to Zenon’s. There are several new readings, but not all of them have been published.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn7" n="7"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar may have planned a comprehensive re-edition of the letters of the archive but only republished four of them (<ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34083">Edgar 1932</ref>). The introduction to <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2492">P.Pestm.Zen. C</ref> (= P.Petr. Kleon 17) acknowledges ‘an unpublished transcription by C. C. Edgar, which was put at our disposal by T. C. Skeat’. This comes from a notebook with a brief introduction and transcriptions in loose leaves, which is the source of readings attributed to ‘Edgar <seg style="font-style: italic;">in schedis</seg>’ in P.Petr. Kleon (personal communication from Willy Clarysse, whom we thank). Cf. n. *88.</p></note> Suggestions on another Petrie papyrus (<seg style="font-weight: bold;">28</seg>) have also remained unpublished. Some emendations were published only indirectly (<seg style="font-weight: bold;">21</seg>), while others coincide with corrections proposed by others in more recent years (<seg style="font-weight: bold;">24</seg>).</p>
               <p xml:id="p4" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Letters <seg style="font-weight: bold;">32</seg> and <seg style="font-weight: bold;">34</seg> relate to Edgar’s work on <seg style="font-style: italic;">Select Papyri</seg>. As indicated in Hunt’s preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3040">Select Papyri I</ref>, dated May 1932, Edgar ‘recently took upon himself the bulk of the work’. We now learn that he assisted Hunt by taking over the Greek texts, i.e. their copying in the first instance, and the translations, which was the greatest but also the dullest share of the workload. Edgar expressed a sense of inadequacy in relation to the task (letter <seg style="font-weight: bold;">32</seg>), which is understandable; he had come to papyrology some twenty years later than Hunt,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn8" n="8"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar’s earlier field of study was archaeology; his first papyrological article dates from 1917 (Edgar 1917).</p></note> and his expertise was in the early Ptolemaic period, whereas the selection spanned a millennium. These letters, too, contain textual suggestions that have received little notice.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn9" n="9"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Several new readings are indicated as ‘E.-H.’ or ‘revised reading’ in the apparatus to <seg style="font-style: italic;">Select Papyri</seg>. Only a small number of these have been reported in the <seg style="font-style: italic;">Berichtigungsliste</seg>.</p></note></p>
               <p xml:id="p5" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The last letter (<seg style="font-weight: bold;">35</seg>) signals the beginning of Edgar’s penultimate editorial project. This was also prompted by Hunt, although unintentionally. After Hunt’s death on 18 June 1934, Edgar ‘undertook the very laborious task of completing the work on Part ii of Vol. iii of the Tebtunis papyri’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn10" n="10"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell 1938: 134. <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/23487">Youtie (1942</ref>: 244) called it a ‘repugnant task’.</p></note> In the preface to <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3740">P.Tebt. III.2</ref>, Edgar noted that ‘the bulk of the material had not yet been examined by’ Hunt, and he was anxious not to appear inferior to the task: ‘I can only hope that the transitions from his hand to mine are not too apparent.’ Hardly anyone, however, would make such a comparison, and ‘it should be made clear that chief credit is due to Edgar’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn11" n="11"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/23484">Skeat 1939</ref>: 218; Skeat, working in the British Museum, had first-hand knowledge of the making of the volume. Cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/23487">Youtie 1942</ref>: 245.</p></note> Like Hunt, Edgar did not live to see the volume in print, as he died shortly before its appearance, on 9 May 1938.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn12" n="12"><p style="text-align: justify; "> See Bell 1938: 134. The 9th is the date given in Edgar’s death notice and probate; biographical notices and even the inscription on his grave refer to the 10th.</p></note> He had almost completed his work on <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/3949">P.Cair.Zen. 5</ref>, published posthumously; this was a fitting conclusion to Edgar’s journey in papyrology, which began and ended with Zenon.</p>

               <p xml:id="p8" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Mr. Bell,</p>
               <p xml:id="p9" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for your letter and postcard. It was very kind of you to send me these chronological notes, and I am very glad to know what the B.M. collection contains in the way of evidence concerning the different systems of dating. </p>
               <p xml:id="p10" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">In no. 2088 I wonder if it is possible to restore  λ Δαισίου ια, Παῦνι ια .<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn13" n="13"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1530">P.Lond. 7 1967</ref>. The date appears in the edition as ̣ λ̣α̣, Δ̣α̣ι̣σ̣ί[ο]υ̣ ι̣  ̣, Π̣αῦνι ια (l. 7), with the note that ‘Δαισίου ια could be read’.</p></note></p>
               <p xml:id="p11" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If the date of no. 2097 is year 39, Phamenoth 10 (and not year 35),<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn14" n="14"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1570">P.Lond. 7 2008</ref>. The year is also read as 39 in the edition. </p></note> an interesting question is raised. On the generally accepted chronology (which I see no reason for disputing), Ptolemy II died in the early spring of his 39th canonical or Egyptian year, several months before Phamenoth 10. But the date \of 2097/ may quite well refer to the financial year,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn15" n="15"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The edition also takes it to be the financial year.</p></note> for some new evidence has come to light that the financial year began in Mecheir, in the reign of Ptolemy II as well as Ptolemy III. So Phamenoth of financial year 39 would be equivalent to Phamenoth of the 38th Egyptian year and (I think, but this is more doubtful) to Phamenoth of the 37th Macedonian year. Why is it that while so many papyri are dated year 39 of Ptolemy II and year 2 of Ptolemy III, scarcely any belong to year 1 (see the index to P. Hib. and P. Petrie)?<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn16" n="16"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/54529">Pestman et al. 1981</ref>: 198. </p></note> It may be a mere accident, but I think a more probable explanation is that a large number of papyri || are dated by the financial year, and the financial year 1 of Euergetes was extremely short, not more than a month and a half.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn17" n="17"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar offers a synthesis on ‘the problem of dating’ in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, pp. 50–57. The conclusion (p. 55) does not differ from his views expressed in this letter. On the chronology in the Zenon papyri, see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/54529">Pestman et al. 1981</ref>: 215–222, which however is not the definitive account; cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/79269">Bennett 2011</ref>.</p></note></p>

               <p xml:id="p30" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Dear Mr. Bell,</p>
               <p xml:id="p31" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The papyrus containing the epigrams has now been photographed, but I am afraid the photo is a little smaller than the original. The actual dimensions of the text are: height 26½ cm., greatest width 20 cm. I have told the photographer to send the negative and a print direct to Gilson.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn25" n="25"><p style="text-align: justify; "> J. P. Gilson (1868–1929) was Keeper of Manuscripts in the British Museum.</p></note></p>
               <p xml:id="p32" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The text is more fully preserved than the photograph might lead you to think, for some letters which are lost or nearly illegible on the <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">recto</seg> have left quite clear impressions on the <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">verso</seg>.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn26" n="26"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar 1918b: 173 records the first case of mirror writing in a Zenon papyrus; see in general <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/81466">D’Alessio 2012</ref>: 296–298 (we owe the reference to D. Kaltsas).</p></note></p>
               <p xml:id="p33" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I have one or two corrections to make. In l. 6, which has to be deciphered from the <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">verso</seg>, the first word is probably [λ]ό̣χμα̣ι̣ς̣. Instead of ἀμ̣ε̣ρ̣γόμενος read ἀμ̣εργόμενος, for ερ is quite distinct on the verso. || In l. 10 I think I can read (again from the <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">verso</seg>) [ο]ὐκ̣ ἀ̣ν̣έμυσεν, but I am not quite sure. In l. 14 read σ⟦κκ⟧ύλαξ.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn27" n="27"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar’s new reading in l. 10 is alluded to in Wilcken 1920: 454.

The corrections to lines 6 and 14 were incorporated in <ref target="https://papyri.info/dclp/65682">P.Cair.Zen. 4 59532</ref>, but Edgar read οὐ πρ[ὶ]ν̣ ἔμυσεν in l. 10.</p></note></p>

               <p xml:id="p44" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I should have written before now to thank you for the information in your last letter and also for the reprint of your excellent bibliography,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn33" n="33"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell 1921.</p></note> but I have been ill and have only now returned to work.</p>

Though I hope to be in England shortly, I do not wish to carry antiquities out of Egypt, so I am going to send it to you after getting the Museum permit and paying the customs dues.

The <ref target="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/a/apis/x-7785/">APIS entry</ref> records that the papyrus ‘was forwarded to London by CC Edgar’. A letter of F. W. Kelsey to H. I. Bell dated 25 June 1921 (in BL Add. MS 89298) relates the following: ‘Under date of June 12th Mr C.C. Edgar wrote to me that he has sent to you for me a papyrus which Dr. Grenfell selected last year but which I had no time to acquire before leaving Cairo. Mr White obtained it for me, and delivered it to Mr Edgar, who kept it at the Museum. This is paid for independently, and if you will be good enough to keep it for me till I go to London it will be an additional favour.’</p></note></p>

               <p xml:id="p49" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for your interesting letter, which I have just received. Yes, I called on you at the British Museum in September, but found you were away on leave. Perhaps I may be more fortunate next summer. The fine Zenon papyri which you mention were offered to us indirectly last spring, but the price asked was far beyond our resources. We may possibly get another collection of fragments, but it is doubtful; like most European Museums we are in very low water.</p>
               <p xml:id="p50" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If your no. 2312<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn36" n="36"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2384">P.Lond. 7 1941</ref>.</p></note> is between 120 and 125<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn37" n="37"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell pencilled ‘124 mm’; the height is given as 12.5 cm in the edition.</p></note> mill. high, I believe that we have a fragment of the same letter.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn38" n="38"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Transcribed in the next letter.</p></note> I will send you my copy as soon as I have revised it on the original, but the Museum is shut until the 13th.

In any case your new fragment not only enables us to understand my no. 11 with greater exactness, but also explains a thing which had puzzled me.

Your no. 2312 now gives the gist of the first half. Something of this sort seems to have happened. Hierokles wrote no. 11 first, found it not quite satisfactory, and wrote the other two letters instead of it. But by some mistake no. 11 was sent to Zenon as well as the other two; perhaps by a different messenger, as it arrived a day later. I infer that no. 11 was the rejected copy from the fact that it is less correctly expressed. See especially the phrase in l. 2: ἔγραψάς μοι εἰ μὲν ἀκρειβῶς ἐπιστάμεθα ἀλείφειν αὐτόν    . As the words stand this means ‘you told us to train him if we know exactly how to do so’. But the new letter shows that Hierokles meant to say ‘if we are perfectly sure that he will win’. Incidentally it makes two other points quite clear, 1) that Pyrrhos was being trained to compete in the games and 2) that Hierokles wrote from Alexandria (see the expression καταγαγηις in l.11).</p>

               <p xml:id="p75" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Your notes are always interesting. One of the fragments which you transcribe completes a letter in our collection beginning [Απολλωνιος] Ζηνωνι χαιρειν. μοσχευματα απιων και φυτα οτι [πλειστ]α παρακομισον εγ Μεμφεως  .</p>

               <p xml:id="p77" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">With regard to the other fragment I remember, but cannot at the moment lay my hand on, a papyrus of ours in which there is mention of honey having been delivered to an Asklepiades. So I should say that the entry on the || verso of your fragment is certainly connected with the recto and should read something like this </p>
               <p xml:id="p78" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">παρα (or παρ’) and then some proper name (Αρτεμιδωρου?)</p>
               <p xml:id="p79" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">περι μελιτος, δουναι τωι παρα Ασκληπιαδου.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn45" n="45"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/1531">P.Lond. 7 1968</ref>.13–15 παρ’ Ἀρτεμιδώρου | περὶ μέλιτος, δοῦναι τῶι παρὰ | Ἀσκληπιάδου.</p></note></p>
               <p xml:id="p80" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If we find that we have each a number of fragments which would complete some of the papyri in our respective collections, would Br. Mus. be willing to make an exchange? There would be no difficulty on our side, but you may perhaps be bound to stricter rules. We have already exchanged some fragments with Florence, to the advantage of both collections; and it seems to me a very commendable practice. </p>

               <p xml:id="p82" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">P.S.

I have sent a small contribution, straight to Otto as you directed.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn47" n="47"><p style="text-align: justify; "> As evidenced by a letter from Schubart to Bell dated 16 Feb. 1922 (BL Add. MS 59518, f. 58), F. Hiller von Gaertringen (Berlin) and W. Otto (Munich) organized a fundraising initiative to support Wilcken’s research on the occasion of his 60th birthday (18 Dec. 1922). Bell communicated this plan to others; in addition to Edgar’s letter, this <seg style="font-style: italic;">Wilckenspende</seg> is mentioned in letters to Bell from Hunt (BL Add. MS 59512, ff. 93 and 94, dated 13 March and 18 May 1922 respectively) and Boak (BL Add. MS 59508, f. 28, dated 30 April 1922).</p></note></p>
               <p xml:id="p86" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">We bought some more Zenon papyri the other day, chiefly fragments. So far as I have examined them, they are not up to the standard of our previous purchases and seizures, though they contain many interesting things. But I shall have no time to study them till next winter. Did Kelsey buy the fine pieces you told me of?</p>

               <p xml:id="p90" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">	I have prepared a packet of my copies of more than two hundred Zenon fragments, some of which ought surely to complete or be completed by the fragments in the B.M. Instead of sending them through the post I will bring them myself on Tuesday or some other day this week. In case I do not see you I should like to call your attention to the following points:</p>
               <p xml:id="p91" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">	They are for the most part unrevised copies and no doubt contain many errors, especially among the letters next to the breaks. As they are my only copies I should like to have them back before I return to Cairo, say about the 20th of July. The measurements are in centimetres and millimetres, height and width; || and by height I mean the height of the recto of the document, quite irrespective of the direction of the fibres. ‘Written along’ a ‘written horizontally’ means that the writing is in line with the fibres; ‘written across’ means that it is at right angles to them.</p>
               <p xml:id="p92" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">	Sincerely hoping that I am not inviting you to undertake a pointless labour, </p>

I can’t say why || J.G. Milne won’t: he has plenty of time, surely. Another possibility occurs to me in C.C. Edgar who has just left Egypt for good. I should imagine that he is likely to settle somewhere within reach of books. He wrote lately that he hopes to be in Oxford shortly and would like to see me, so I could mention it if you like.’ Bell had been responsible for compiling the bibliography for Graeco-Roman Egypt in <seg style="font-style: italic;">JEA</seg> since 1914. The instalment published in 1927 was signed by three contributors (Bell et al. 1927), with a note by Bell explaining the background. His promotion to Deputy Keeper in 1927 increased the difficulty of the task. The next instalment was the work of eight contributors (Milne et al. 1928); J.G. Milne was among them, but not Edgar (or Segrè). Edgar only contributed the section on ‘Publications of non-literary texts’ in the bibliography for 1932–1933 (Milne et al. 1934: 88–92), replacing Bell.</p></note></p>
               <p xml:id="p127" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">At present I am compiling the Index to my catalogue, a long but unavoidable piece of drudgery, but I hope to come next week to the B.M., Tuesday or Wednesday, and put in a few || hours on the Michigan papyri. It is good news that your Ptolemaic volume is now in prospect.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn65" n="65"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell (1927a: 1) noted that ‘vol. VI of the Catalogue, … will, it is hoped, contain all the Ptolemaic papyri acquired since 1906’. This had been the plan for some time (‘Volume VI of the Museum Catalogue is likely to consist entirely of Ptolemaic texts.’ [Bell 1922: 100]), and this remained the case in the years that followed (‘vol. VI … will consist entirely of Ptolemaic papyri’ [<ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/34376">Bell 1933</ref>: 514]). The project was subsequently handed over to T. C.

It is true also that the name of Zenon continued to be prominent in Philadelphia after our Zenon’s death, like that of his partner Sostratos (see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95152">Partsch - Wilcken, Jur.

Nor is it easy to see how the Corpus Christi account fell into Zenon’s hands. But on the || whole I must admit that at least three dated documents later than the bulk of the find do probably belong to it and that Z. did probably not die, or retire from Philadelphia, as early as I used to suppose.</p>

Nikios was an important town midway between Naukratis and Memphis. My suggested reading of l. 60 must be wrong, but I suppose it cannot be corrected into ἐπὶ τοῦ Δέλτα.

               <p xml:id="p156" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking through some of the Hamburg papyri I came upon a reference to <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/36938">P. Lond. V., 1764</ref>, 4, τὴν τοῦ οἴνου καλλονὴν καὶ παραμονήν. Would you mind telling me if the context shows καλλονήν to mean some process of clarifying the wine, or if some other meaning is indicated. Meyer’s καλλοινήν (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 90</ref>) seems to me rather questionable, and I do not feel much confidence in his transcriptions. He has made nonsense of no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28701">87</ref> by reading Βαιβ̣ίνης instead of the obvious βαροίνῃς (= βαρύνῃς), ‘do not burden yourself with the wedding outfit, but bring a reasonable amount’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn84" n="84"><p style="text-align: justify; "> βαρύνῃς was doubtfully conjectured by Schubart (BL 2.2.75); βαροίνῃς was read on the original much later (BL 13.105).</p></note> In no. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">88</ref> again the word which he reads as ἐγαίσησες and which Wilcken amends into ἐγαὶς Ἦσες (= ὑγιὴς Ἦσις) is no doubt ἐγάμησες, as is shown by the phrase in l. 7 καὶ νῦν ὡς ἄνθρωπος τέλειος || γενάμενος ‘and now also that you are a married man’ (Hesych. τέλειοι οἱ γεγαμηκότες).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn85" n="85"><p style="text-align: justify; "> <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/28702">P.Hamb. 1 88</ref> was reedited in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 556–562, who read ἐγάμησες on a photograph (BL 5.40). <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/44020">Youtie 1961</ref>: 561 accepted Meyer’s legal interpretation of τέλειος.</p></note> So I should not be surprised if he also has gone wrong over καλλοινήν.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn86" n="86"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The passage (<ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/31471">P.Hamb. 1 90</ref>.5–7) was read as ὡς ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ π̣ε|ρὶ τοῦ γόμου τοῦ οἴνο̣υ, ἐ̣κλί|σθη καλῶς καὶ τὴν καλλοιν̣[ὴν   ̣  ̣  ̣  ̣] καὶ ἐ̣σφράγισα. The <ref target="http://resolver.sub.uni-hamburg.de/goobi/HANSh817">online image</ref> shows that καλλοι is possible, but there is no word beginning καλλοιν- ; the upright could also belong to nu. After that, there are traces of two letters; καλλον̣ή̣ν̣ is conceivable, but it is difficult to account for the accusative in the sequence. (In l. 5, read ἐνετείλ⟦λ⟧ω μοι  instead of ἐνέτειλα Ὥρῳ; cf. <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/110132">P.Sijp 9_d</ref>.8.)</p></note></p>
               <p xml:id="p157" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">There is a difficult phrase in one of the Zenon texts, <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/2080">P.S.I. 396</ref>, τῆς προστάδος των καλαίνων οὗ   κε οἶνος κεῖται μου. Surely καλαίνων can mean nothing but the cellars (can it be misread for καμαρίων ?),<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn87" n="87"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Later corrected to καμίνων (BL 3.223).</p></note> and it strikes me as possible that what the writer of Hamb. 90 sealed up was not the wine-jars but the deck-house in which they were loaded.

               <p xml:id="p162" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">If the Petrie papyrus DXX (= <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7650">P.Petr.

               <p xml:id="p188" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Looking up the passages in which ἐνοχλεῖσθαι is used of animals, I came across a curious phrase in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7495">P.Petrie II, no. 25 (a)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον ἐνοχλούμενον ἐγλοηθέν  θατα. In P.Petrie III Smyly quotes Mayser to the effect that ἐγλοηθέντα = ἐγλογηθέντα, ‘ausgeschieden’. The phrase recurs in <ref target="https://papyri.info/hgv/7496">P.P. II, no. 25 (b)</ref>, εἰς ἵππον \ἐνοχλούμενον/ ἐγλοηθέντα καὶ φλεβοτομηθέντα, but in the facsimile it seems to me that the word is clearly ἐγλουσθέντα, ‘after having received a drench and been bled.’ If you have time one day, could you verify on the originals (B.M. DLIX–X<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn96" n="96"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The actual inventory numbers are DLVIII–DLIX (558–559).</p></note>) whether my reading is right.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn97" n="97"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Bell pencilled, ‘probably’. Mayser’s interpretation, quoted in P.Petr. 3 61b, had also been questioned by Wilcken, who suggested that ἐγλοηθέντα stands for ἐκλουθέντα (Wilcken 1906: 519 = BL 1.360).</p></note> Mayser’s explanation strikes me as very far-fetched.</p>
               <p xml:id="p189" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I hope you found the three off-prints on your table. Many thanks for the loan. </p>

               <p xml:id="p193" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Would you mind giving me an impartial opinion on the following point?</p>
               <p xml:id="p194" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">The question that I have to decide is whether the enclosed “Form of the papyri etc” should be printed in full or reduced to a brief formal note like that in your <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95201">Jews and Christians</ref>. The latter course would be simpler and would improve the make-up of the book. The former course would necessitate the transference of the note from the preliminary matter \(in which it is out of scale)/ to a place between the Introduction and the Texts. But is the information which it gives about the form of a typical Ptolemaic letter of sufficient interest to justify a departure from the ordinary arrangement? Or do you think that to any likely reader the information is superfluous? ||</p>
               <p xml:id="p195" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I am in doubt myself and should in any case attach more weight to your opinion than to my own in a question of this sort.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn98" n="98"><p style="text-align: justify; "> Edgar ultimately opted for the ‘former course’; see <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95210">P.Mich.Zen.</ref>, pp. 58–60 (‘The form of the papyri and the method of publication’).</p></note></p>

               <p xml:id="p199" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">Many thanks for the trouble you have taken about my proofs. It is satisfactory in a negative way to know that none of your fragments can be fitted on.</p>
               <p xml:id="p200" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I observed lately that <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.Cairo</seg> 59415 and <seg style="text-decoration: underline;">P.S.I.</seg> 376 make up a nearly complete letter from Deinon dated L λϛ Υπερβερε ιζ. <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn99" n="99"><p style="text-align: justify; "> The join was noted in <ref target="https://papyri.info/biblio/95113">P.Cair.Zen. 4</ref>, p. 289.

L. 8 does not trouble me for it might be restored somewhat like this ὅτι γὰρ π[οιήσομεν δεῖ σε] νοεῖν. The only difficulty is in l. 4, where εἰ δὴ μέν   ought to be εἰδῶμεν and Grenfell’s ]εαιει is not quite intelligible.

               <p xml:id="p201" style="text-align: left; text-align: justify;">I should much like to see the re-discovered Petrie papyri and hope to have an opportunity some day soon.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn102" n="102"><p style="text-align: justify; "> It is unclear what these papyri were.
